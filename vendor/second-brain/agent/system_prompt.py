"""Cache-friendly system prompt assembly.

Returns two messages:
- A combined ``system`` message at position 0 — the static prompt followed
  by the semi-stable readouts, one document with no header between them,
  cacheable across turns.
- A ``user`` message tagged ``[SYSTEM CONTEXT UPDATE]`` carrying the
  dynamic runtime context. ``ConversationLoop._messages`` places it as its
  own row immediately before the latest real user turn.

The user-role wrapper exists because some providers (MiniMax) reject
``system`` messages anywhere except position 0. It is the weakest part of
this arrangement and it is a compromise, not a preference: a model reads the
role before it reads the disclaimer, so context the kernel generated arrives
wearing the user's voice. Giving it its own row rather than welding it onto
the person's own words is as far as that can be fixed without knowing what
the backend accepts.

A caution about where the dynamic block actually ends up, because this used
to claim it rides "at the tail of the prompt" and that is only half true. It
sits ahead of whatever ``_split_current_turn`` finds, which is the *last*
row with ``role == "user"``. In a conversation that is near the end, and the
cacheable prefix is everything before it. In an agentic run there is exactly
one user message — the task — followed by dozens of assistant and tool rows,
so "last" is also "first" and the block sits at index 1, ahead of the whole
transcript. Every byte that moves in it therefore re-bills every row behind
it. Treat anything in the ``dynamic`` list as costing the entire
conversation, not a suffix of it, and see ``_current_datetime`` for what that
cost measured.

    declares a method taking the context. Accepting both under one name is
    load-bearing rather than merely tidy, because a string shadowing a method
    would otherwise raise ``TypeError`` into the ``except`` below and the
    guidance would vanish with no symptom at all.

    The shape decides *how to ask*, and it is still ``callable`` that answers —
    deliberately its own question, since the tolerance above is what depends on
    it. What decides *where the text lands* is the plugin's declared cue:
    ``prompt_cues.stable`` is true for the rungs that cannot move within a
    conversation, and their text rides in the semi-stable block of the
    cacheable position-0 prefix. Everything finer goes to the dynamic block
    with the kernel's own live state, which is the argument ``_mode_suffix``
    makes for itself in ``runtime/runtime_config.py``.

    The two used to be one question — a string in the prefix, a method in the
    dynamic block, and no declaration needed to tell them apart. That was right
    about the string and too coarse about the method: a prompt that only
    follows the permission mode does not move within a conversation any more
    than a fixed one does, and paying for it at the volatile end of the prompt
    on every call was the only option it had.

    Within a block, rarest first. That ordering pays in the prefix, where a
    provider re-reads from the first byte that changed; in the dynamic block it
    is cosmetic, since the whole message is rebuilt per call either way. The
    sort is **stable**, so contributions on one rung keep ``_in_scope``'s
    reading order — tools, then services, tasks, commands and the frontend.

    Answers with the contributions as a *list*, one per plugin, which the
    caller splats into its block list and joins there. Joining here instead
    produced identical bytes — ``"\n\n".join`` is associative over the same
    separator — but it meant one opaque blob where the prompt actually has
    several sections, so nothing downstream could say which plugin wrote
    which. ``dev/dump_agent_text.py`` needs exactly that, and inferring it

    block sits ahead of the entire tool-call transcript, and any byte that
    moves in it invalidates the cached prefix for every row behind it.
    ``%I:%M %p`` is *fixed width*, so a minute rollover changes the prefix and
    changes nothing about the length: measured across 636 benchmark trials,
    calls built inside one minute collapsed the prefix 1.4% of the time and
    calls that crossed a minute boundary collapsed it 33.3% of the time,
    together carrying 27–45% of all billed-uncached input.

    Rendering once per turn costs the agent nothing it was promised. The block
    announces itself as state "refreshed each turn", and
    ``system_prompt_static.md`` tells the reader to expect it to change
    *between* turns. Minute precision is kept, because relative-date reasoning

    fact and must not be keyed as one. Sharing one string across sessions is
    correct; the worst a race can do here is render twice.

    The ceiling exists because a turn is not time-bounded. ``turn`` fires once

    ``None`` there means *the provider did not say*, which is not zero (see

    measurement, so there is no line.

    ``context_size`` is 0 whenever the profile has not declared

    0 and ``/llm`` says "use 0 if unknown". That is a missing *denominator*,
