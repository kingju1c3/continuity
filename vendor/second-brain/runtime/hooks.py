"""The doorways around the agent turn — one registry, six moments.

Every agent turn is the same short ritual: the turn starts, the model thinks,
the agent acts, think/act repeats, the turn ends. This module puts a labeled
doorway at every moment of that ritual, and the one rule of the whole system
is: **nothing influences a turn except by standing at a doorway.** If nobody
is registered at a doorway, the kernel walks straight through and behaves
exactly as it would with no hooks at all.

The six moments (in the order a turn meets them):

=================  ==========  =====================================================
Moment             Kind        What standing there means
=================  ==========  =====================================================
``turn_start``     adjuster    The agent is about to begin; slip a note into its
                               pocket (mutate the session: prompt extras,
                               staged attachments, queued actions).
``shape_scope``    adjuster    Here is the toolbox the agent will see; hand back
                               a changed one.
``vet_permission`` verdict     The agent wants to run something sensitive; say
                               yes, say no, or stay silent.
``llm_call``     escort      Own the round trip to the model: rewrite the
                               request, place the call yourself, inspect the
                               answer, and go around again if you don't like it.
``end_turn``       verdict     The doorman at the exit: the agent says "I'm
                               done" — let it leave, send it back with a note,
                               or demand one last tool call first.
``turn_finish``    observer    The turn is over; look at what happened. Touch
                               nothing.
=================  ==========  =====================================================

Three kinds of doorway:

- **Observer** — watches, touches nothing.
- **Adjuster** — handed a thing, may return a changed thing, never sees what
  happens next. (A verdict is an adjuster whose answer is a decision object;
  the first non-``None`` answer wins.)
- **Escort** — signature ``fn(ctx, payload, proceed)``. The escort holds both
  the request and the phone: it decides when to dial (``proceed``), sees the
  response before anyone else, and may redial. Escorts nest like an onion —
  the first registered is the outermost wrapper.

The uniform contract, enforced here so every hook can rely on it:

- Every hook receives ``(ctx, payload)`` — ``ctx`` is a :class:`HookContext`
  (session, runtime, moment), ``payload`` is the moment-specific dataclass.
- Return ``None`` to abstain; return a value to speak.
- A raising hook is logged and skipped — a hook can never break a turn. For
  escorts, "skipped" means transparent: the call proceeds as if the escort
  were not there (and a response already obtained is never thrown away or
  fetched twice).

Registration: ``runtime.hooks.add(moment, fn)`` from a service's
``bind_runtime``/``_load``; ``runtime.hooks.remove(fn)`` at unload. See
``templates/hook_template.py`` for worked examples of every kind.

Ordering: hooks run in registration order — which is simply plugin load order —
and for escorts the first registered is the outermost wrapper. There is
deliberately no priority knob; add one only when two real plugins actually
conflict.

How the two *verdict* doorways settle a disagreement differs, on purpose:

- ``end_turn`` is **first non-None wins**. An early ``Allow`` positively waves
  the agent through and later doormen are not consulted.
- ``vet_permission`` is **deny beats allow**. Every gate is asked, and any
  refusal wins however late it comes.

Composition follows the cost of being wrong. A doorman that guesses wrong costs
a turn; a gate that guesses wrong costs a capability. Under first-wins a
permissive gate loaded before a restrictive one silently decided policy by
filename order, which is not a decision anybody makes on purpose.

      failed *tool* call is feedback, not an ending; the loop continues.)
    - ``"no_action"`` — the loop asked for an action and got none.
    - ``"crashed"`` — ``drive`` raised. Set by the runtime, not the loop, which

    - ``"redrive"`` — the drive ended so the turn could be driven again.

        registered escort wraps the next; the first registered is outermost.
        A raising escort is skipped *transparently*: if it already fetched a
        response via ``proceed``, that response is used (never re-fetched);
        if it raised before dialing, the call proceeds as if the escort were
        not there.
