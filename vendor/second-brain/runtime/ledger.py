"""Helpers that feed the action ledger from the runtime's chokepoints.

The ledger is the kernel's flight recorder: every action that flows through
the two labeled ``cs.enact(...)`` sites is appended to the ``action_ledger``
table, alongside ``origin="system"`` rows for acts that happen outside the
state machine (package installs, config saves, conversation lifecycle ops).

Everything here is best-effort twice over: ``db.record_action`` already
swallows its own failures, and these helpers additionally tolerate a missing
or stubbed ``db`` (unit tests run the runtime with ``db=None`` or fakes), so
a chokepoint stays one readable call with no try/except at the call site.

    moves chain and context together, while a resident service polling on its
    own initiative is handed ``kernel_context(None)`` and correctly records
    nothing, because a service poll belongs to no conversation.

    The conversation is resolved through the live session rather than stored on
    the context, because a session's conversation changes underneath it — a
    ``/new`` or a ``conv.load`` rebinds it — and the row should say which
    conversation the effect actually landed in.

    Without one the sandbox records nothing at all, which left the flight
    recorder blind to every effect a plugin performed — the one part of the
    system where unattended operation most needs to be reconstructable after
    the fact.

    **A row says whose work it was**, via ``identity_of`` on the trailing
    context. It did not for a long time, and the omission was invisible because
    the columns existed and simply held NULL: ``action_ledger`` carries
    ``session_key``/``conversation_id``/``user_id`` and an index on
    ``(conversation_id, id)`` built for exactly this, and the sandbox origin —
    the highest-volume one, and the only per-effect record the system has — was
    the one origin that filled none of them. So ``get_ledger_rows(
    conversation_id=…)`` answered nothing for plugin effects and the index was
    dead weight, while ``my_action_ledger`` (which scopes on ``user_id``) hid
    every sandbox row from plugin code including its own. The enact sites had
    supplied all three since the beginning; this is the sandbox catching up
    rather than a new claim.

    **Reads are not recorded, effects and refusals always are.** A console
    frontend issues a ``console.read`` Request every poll; at the 50 ms default
    that is twenty rows a second, forever, and it would bury the rows worth
    reading under about 1.7 million a day of nothing happening. The
    ``READ_ONLY`` set already draws exactly this line and exists for exactly
    this question. Anything the kernel had to *ask* about, and anything it
    refused, is kept regardless of type — a denied read is a real event even
    though the read itself would not have been.

    ``llm.delta`` is the one *write* held to the same rule, and it is the
    worse case: a streaming backend sends one per token, so a single reply
    wrote thousands of rows, each an INSERT and a commit under the database's
    one lock — serializing the whole database against the model at fifty to a
    hundred round trips a second. It buys nothing either, since the call and
    the enact are already recorded and this is only the model's own output
    kept a character at a time. It is dropped here rather than added to
    ``READ_ONLY``, which says what it holds: things that read rather than
    change. What the sink drops is the sink's question.

    Built here rather than in the sandbox because it is the sandbox's *origin*
    on a kernel table; ``sandbox/`` stays ignorant of the database, and the
    composition root hands this in like it hands in the approver.
