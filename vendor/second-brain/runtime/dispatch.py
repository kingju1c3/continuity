"""Per-action dispatch helpers.

The runtime's ``_dispatch`` is the single labeled enact() site for the
user-side state machine. To keep the dispatch loop readable, the small
per-action concerns (selecting the right ``content`` shape, mirroring
state-machine results into the ``RuntimeResult``, emitting
phase/turn-changed events, decorating forms for frontend rendering) are
factored out here as plain functions.

Each helper does one thing and is named after the question it answers, so
the dispatch loop reads top-to-bottom like a checklist.
