"""Per-session configuration: profile, scope, registry, system prompt, loop.

The runtime owns one global agent profile + tool registry, but each session
can override the profile and pin extra tools. The
helpers in this module compute the *effective* configuration for a given
session — the LLM to use, the tool registry the agent sees, the system
prompt that gets sent on every turn — and build the :class:`ConversationLoop`
that drives the agent's turn.

These functions are thin: they read from ``runtime`` and ``session`` and
return derived values. They never mutate persistence; they don't touch
session locks. Keep it that way.
