"""Starting the web app, and saying where it ended up.

``frame_ui/`` is part of this repo, so the kernel can treat it the way it
treats a frontend: something it owns and therefore something it starts. What
makes that worth doing rather than leaving to a second terminal is the failure
it removes — a UI that is one forgotten ``npm run dev`` away from working looks
exactly like a UI that is broken.

Three steps, in an order that matters:

1. **Probe first.** Something may already be serving — a dev server left
   running from before a ``/restart``, or a real deployment (the macOS install
   serves a build through Caddy and has no dev server at all). Starting a
   second one would bind-fail at best and fight over the port at worst, so a
   reachable address is taken as the answer and nothing is spawned.
2. **Start it, if nothing answered and the user wants that.**
3. **Say where it is**, once it actually works. The notification is the
   *point* — "it is running" is not useful, "open this" is — which is why it is
   raised on a successful probe rather than when the process starts. A process
   that starts and then exits on a port conflict is exactly the case a
   start-time notice would get wrong.

**"Works" means the bridge, not the port**, and that distinction was learned
the hard way. A dev server left over from before an update served its page
perfectly while proxying without a credential, so every Request came back
`unauthorized` — and the start-up notice cheerfully announced an address that
could not talk to the kernel. A page answering says a process is alive; one
authenticated Request through the same origin says the thing the user wants is
true. So the probe asks for both, and when they disagree it says which.

**Delivery waits for somewhere to deliver to.** A notification reaches live
sessions only, so one raised before a frontend has opened its session is
persisted to the panel and shown to nobody — which is exactly as useful as not
raising one. The adopt path made that the *normal* case rather than a race,
since an already-running server answers the first probe in milliseconds.

**Stopping it is a question about ownership, and the unit is the app rather
than the process.** "Only stop what you started" is right and was one word too
narrow: a ``/restart`` re-execs, so the server still serving afterwards is one
this app started a life ago, and a process that reads *started* as "started by
me" adopts it and then declines to stop it forever. One ungraceful exit and the
dev server outlived every boot for the rest of the machine's uptime, which is
the symptom that got this looked at. The pid of whatever is listening is
therefore written down, and a later boot reclaims a server only when the port
still answers to that pid — so a dev server somebody runs in their own terminal
and a real deployment are both left exactly alone.

Nothing here is fatal. A machine with no Node, a checkout with no
``node_modules``, a port already taken by something else: each is logged and
the kernel carries on, because the web UI is one way in and the REPL is
another.
