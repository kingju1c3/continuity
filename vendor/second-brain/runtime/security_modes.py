"""Per-conversation security mode — the standing answer to an approval dialog.

Three values, and they are exactly the three answers a person can give to the
question "may this run?" before being asked it:

===========  ==========================================================
``lockdown`` No. Refuse anything that would have raised a dialog.
``ask``      Ask me. Today's behaviour, and the default.
``yolo``     Yes. Approve anything that would have raised a dialog.
===========  ==========================================================

**A mode is a standing answer, not a new layer.** It is read at the one point
in :func:`sandbox.approval.build_approver` where the dialog would otherwise be
drawn, which is what gives each value its precise scope: ``yolo`` frees only
work that would have interrupted you, and ``lockdown`` refuses only what would
have reached you. Neither touches what the kernel had already settled without
asking — a plugin's own ``vet_permission`` verdict, or a service reading the
credential it was configured with. Lockdown means "stop asking me, the answer
is no"; it does not mean "break the plugins I already set up".

Two things it deliberately cannot do, both worth saying out loud because a
grant that overstates itself erodes trust in the dialog as fast as one that
understates it erodes safety:

- **Yolo is not root.** Every structural refusal stands — a cross-user read,
  DDL naming a kernel table, ``MAX_DEPTH``, the cycle detector, a desk or
  one-shot token, an unclassified Request. Those never produced a dialog, so
  there is no answer for a mode to stand in for.
- **Yolo never reaches unattended work.** The approver refuses a chain nobody
  is watching *before* it consults the mode, so a cron job or a subagent
  cannot spend a grant you gave for a foreground task.

This module is kernel rather than ``sandbox/`` because two layers read it: the
sandbox approver, and the state machine's command grant
(``state_machine/action.py``). It holds the vocabulary and nothing else — where
the value is *stored* is :class:`runtime.session.RuntimeSession`, and who may
change it is ``sandbox.policy.classify``.
