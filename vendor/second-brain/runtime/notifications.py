"""Notifications: what the system tells the user, as its own kind of event.

Two things live here, and they are related but not the same.

**Per-conversation notification mode** decides whether a background session
replays its final answer at all ("on") or stays silent ("off"). Older
"all" / "important" markers normalize to "on" so existing scheduled
conversations keep surfacing results.

**``notify()``** is the one way anything in the kernel raises a notification.
It exists because ``CHAT_MESSAGE_PUSHED`` carried two populations a frontend
had to tell apart and could not: text belonging to the agent's turn, and
announcements from elsewhere that merely had nowhere else to appear. A plugin
registering itself and the agent answering a question arrived as the same
``render_messages`` call.

The split is decided *at the emit site*, never inferred from the channel. That
matters more than it looks: the two things staying on ``CHAT_MESSAGE_PUSHED``
(the model's mid-turn narration, a tool's ``sdk.ui.render``) are recognisable
today only by being pushes made while the agent's turn owns the session, and a
rule like that is exactly the kind a future producer lands on the wrong side of
without anybody noticing. A notification whose zone never shows it looks
identical to a system with nothing to say.

**``source`` is not stated by whoever asked.** Kernel producers pass a literal
they do not choose at runtime. Sandboxed code passes nothing at all — the
handler reads the leaf of the live provenance chain, which is the part of a
chain a box cannot state about itself. That reading is done in
``sandbox/handlers/kernel.py``, not here: the chain belongs to the sandbox, and
the kernel's notification layer should not have to know it exists.
