"""Programmatic approval / typed-input requests.

A *request* is the runtime's way of pausing a conversation to ask the user
for a value (boolean approval, an enum pick, a free-form string). It comes
in two flavours:

- **Tool-initiated**: a tool calls ``runtime.request_input(...)`` from
  inside its own thread and the call blocks until the user answers.
- **Action-initiated**: a callable with ``require_approval=True`` pushes
  an approval phase frame from inside ``_CallableAction._approval``.

Both paths land on the same phase frame shape (``PHASE_APPROVING_REQUEST``)
and the same ``answer_approval`` action resolves them, so this module's
job is just to set up the frame, register the in-memory request object,
and reconcile when the answer comes back.

The ``form`` rendering of the frame (the dict the frontend renders) lives
in ``runtime_dispatch``.
