"""When a plugin's system-prompt contribution goes stale — the one table.

A plugin contributes to the agent system prompt through ``agent_prompt``, and
the prompt is rebuilt on every **LLM call**, not once per turn. For the method
shape that means a real call into the plugin's box — a module import at
minimum, a subprocess spawn for anything foreign — so the answer has to be
cached, and the cache has to know when the world moved.

This module is that knowledge, and it is a *declaration* rather than an
inference. A plugin names the cue its text follows::

    agent_prompt_refresh = "session"

    def agent_prompt(self, sdk):
        mode = (sdk.session.get() or {}).get("mode")
        return "..." if mode == "lockdown" else ""

What it replaces is one global counter that ticked whenever sandboxed code
changed anything. That counter was right for what it could know — nothing
declared what a prompt method read, so the dependency had to be inferred, and
over-invalidating costs one box call while under-invalidating is silently
wrong. But it made a prompt that only follows the permission mode recompute on
every ``fs.write`` in the process, to re-read something that changes once a
conversation.

The ladder
----------

One total order, least to most frequent. Each rung adds a component to the
cache key, so a plugin at rank L is keyed on the tuple of every component at
rank ``<= L``. That is what makes the ladder a *threshold* rather than a set of
unrelated events: a rarer change invalidates finer-grained plugins, never the
reverse. A ``config`` write therefore refreshes a ``turn``-cued prompt, and a
turn boundary does not refresh a ``config``-cued one.

``never``    the static-string shape. Derived, never declared — see DECLARABLE.
``load``     the loaded plugin population changed. A plugin's *own* reload
             needs no counter, because discovery builds a fresh adapter class
             and instantiates it, so the cache goes with the old object; what
             the counter is for is the other reading, and the one an author
             means by ``load`` — *which plugins exist*. A package install
             writes its files from kernel code and never passes the write
             counter's funnel at all, so without this rung a prompt describing
             what is installed was invalidated only by coincidence.
``config``   a counter, fired once from ``config_manager._emit_config_changed``.
``session``  **not an event.** It is a fact — see SESSION_FACTS — read straight
             off the ``PromptContext`` being built. No fire site can be
             forgotten because there is none, which is the property worth
             protecting: a turn-scoped ``yolo`` cleared by writing the session
             field directly is covered anyway, because the next context simply
             reports a different mode.
``turn``     a counter, fired once from ``HookRegistry.start_turn``.
``write``    the counter this module grew out of, fired from
             ``Interpreter._settle`` for any successful Request that changed
             something. **The default.**
``call``     never cached. Its stamp never compares equal to itself.

The default is safe by *superset*, not by identity
--------------------------------------------------

Before cues, a method's key was ``(epoch, session_key, security_mode)``. A
``write``-cued key is every rung, so the default now also moves on a turn
boundary, a config save, an install, and three more session facts. Every one of
those is a strictly wider invalidation than before, so nothing can go stale
that did not before — but it does cost one extra recompute per turn for a
plugin nothing wrote for. That is the price of the ladder being a ladder: a
rung that did not invalidate the rungs below it would make this a set of
unrelated triggers with no basis for ordering them. A plugin that feels the
cost has a one-word answer available to it: declare the rung it actually
follows.

Placement
---------

``STABLE_THROUGH`` is the line between the two blocks the prompt is assembled
from. Cues at or below it do not move within a conversation, so their text
rides in the semi-stable block of the position-0 ``system`` message; the rest
ride in the dynamic ``[SYSTEM CONTEXT UPDATE]`` block. Within each block
``agent/system_prompt.py`` sorts by rank, rarest first.

That sort pays in the prefix and is cosmetic in the dynamic block, which is
rebuilt per call either way — worth knowing before anyone optimizes it further.

The tier is enforced rather than promised: a cue below ``session`` is answered
with the plain kernel context, so ``sdk.session.get()`` tells it nothing. Note
what this does *not* claim. The position-0 message is already per-session — its
tool catalog is profile-scoped and its command catalog is filtered by the
session's frontend — so the prefix was never session-independent. What it is
is *stable for the life of one session*, and the tier is what keeps a plugin
from being the reason it stops being.

#: Excluding them is load-bearing rather than tidy, because the volume is
#: per-token. A streaming backend sends one ``llm.delta`` per token, and the
#: frontend rendering that stream sends one ``console.write`` per token right
#: behind it (``bundled/frontends/frontend_repl.py``). Counting either would
#: tick thousands of times per reply, so every ``write``-cued ``agent_prompt``

#: entirely — with no symptom beyond being slow, which is why the set is named

#:
#: ``llm.delta`` alone was the first version of this and was not enough: the
#: two halves of one stream arrive as different Request types, and excluding
#: the backend's half while counting the frontend's fixed nothing.
#:
#: The ``http.*`` three are that same second half for a frontend whose screen
#: is somewhere else: an SSE ``http.push`` per token sits behind ``llm.delta``
#: exactly where ``console.write`` sits for the REPL. ``respond`` and ``close``
#: join them not by volume but by the same argument the set is named for —
#: they finish moving text to a person and produce no state a prompt could
#: read back. Only ``http.drain`` is left out, and it is a read.
