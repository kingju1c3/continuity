"""The native face of a tool adapter.

Nothing subclasses this by hand. A tool is sandboxed code, and
``sandbox.bridge`` builds a subclass of this class at load whose ``run``
forwards into a box. What lives here is the half the *tool registry* needs to
see: ``ToolResult``, ``to_schema``, and the declarations both read.

Tools are the on-demand capability layer of Second Brain. A tool accepts
structured input, inspects local state or external systems, and returns a
ToolResult that is useful both to frontends and to the LLM.

Unlike tasks, tools do not run automatically over every file. They are
called explicitly by the agent, the UI, or other tools and return
immediately.

Tool schemas map directly into LLM function calling:
    - name        -> function name
    - description -> function description
    - parameters  -> JSON schema for arguments

The same tool contract is used everywhere: REPL, installed frontends, package
commands, and agent turns. See ``templates/tool_template.py`` for what an
author actually writes.
