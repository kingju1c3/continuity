"""The native face of a frontend adapter — and the host-side routing itself.

Nothing subclasses this by hand. A frontend is sandboxed code, and
``sandbox.bridge`` builds a subclass of this class at load. Unlike the other
four bases this one is not a thin contract: it *is* the routing, and that is
deliberate. The base owns **when** — fourteen bus subscriptions funnelling
into nine ``render_*`` methods, and ``submit_*`` funnelling into
``runtime.handle_action`` — while the guest owns **how**. So the bridge
overrides the nine renderers with one ``render(kind, payload)`` box call and
inherits everything else.

Frontends are the user-facing transports of Second Brain (REPL, installed
Telegram, HTTP, future presentation layers). Each declares its identity and
capabilities, and implements two halves of the contract:

    1. Turn user input into an Action and submit it to ConversationRuntime.
    2. Render the resulting RuntimeResult (and bus-borne events from other
       sessions) back to the user.

Everything else — slash-command parsing, form-step prompting, state-machine
request rendering, session bookkeeping — lives here. See
``templates/frontend_template.py`` for what an author actually writes.
