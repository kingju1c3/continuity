"""The native face of a service adapter.

Nothing subclasses this by hand. A service is sandboxed code, and
``sandbox.bridge`` builds a subclass of this class at load whose ``_load``
opens a persistent box and whose ``unload`` closes it. What lives here is the
half the *kernel* needs to see: the lifecycle it drives, and the declarations
it reads. The behaviour is on the other side of the boundary, in the box.

Services are long-lived capabilities shared across tools and tasks. They wrap
models, schedulers, external APIs, runtime extensions, or other reusable state
and give the rest of the system a consistent lifecycle.
