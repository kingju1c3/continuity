"""The LLM registry — the kernel's answer to "which model, and how do I reach it?"

The LLM used to be a service, and like parsing that was a mistake worth
naming. A service is a *runtime object other code calls*, so every backend had
to be a live ``BaseLLM`` instance the kernel held by reference, and the router
existed to keep a dict of those instances consistent with a dict of config.
Roughly 250 of ``service_llm.py``'s 576 lines were that bookkeeping:
registering one service per profile, resyncing them when a backend file
changed, mirroring five attributes off the resolved default so the router
could impersonate it.

None of it survives the move, because none of it was about talking to a model.

- **The kernel routes.** Which profiles exist, which is the default, which
  backend serves each — standing knowledge, answered in strings, owned here.
- **A backend is a residency, not an endpoint.** It lives in a box, and
  ``load``/``unload`` mean opening and closing that box. That is what makes
  "loaded" honest: it is a live process, not a flag.
- **What crosses is data.** An :class:`LLMRequest` in, an :class:`LLMResponse`
  out, text deltas in between.

A :class:`Brain` is the handle: one per configured profile, holding the
profile's connection settings and a pool of boxes to run them in.

**Why a pool.** ``PersistentBox.call`` serializes under one lock, so a single
box per profile would queue a scheduled subagent behind a foreground turn —
a regression, since provider SDKs are thread-safe today. Backends are
stateless with respect to the profile (every model name and key arrives on the
request), so any box in a pool can serve any call, and the pool simply grows
to meet demand. Its ceiling is the real one: the orchestrator's worker threads
plus the foreground turn is the most concurrent LLM calls that can exist.

        for a backend to get wrong, and nothing in ``llm/`` that knows which
        library is on the other side. A backend that cannot carry a param
        degrades it (the store's LiteLLM sets ``drop_params``) or reports the
        provider's own refusal — which is not reliably a sentence anybody can
        act on, and is the cost of staying ignorant here. It is paid in
        :meth:`_explained` rather than by learning provider names.

        **The kernel used to name one of them.** ``reasoning_effort`` was

        left one profile silently thinking hard and its neighbour not at all.
        That argument rested on the comparison being invisible, and it is not

        row, with the backend's verdict beside it. So the default bought a
        guess where there is now a table, and cost real breakage — a Claude
        profile with thinking on cannot hand its signed ``thinking_blocks``
        back and the API refuses the next tool call. A parameter nobody set is
        not sent.

        **A null still means omit**, and that is a rule about every parameter
        rather than a concession to one. It is what ``/llm`` writes when you
        say to send nothing, and what a hand-edited config can say too.

        Tolerant like ``context_size``, and for the same reason: this is
        user-entered config, and a malformed extras blob must not be able to
        stop the model being reachable. It says so out loud, though — being

#: ``unload``\s the old one — closing the backend's process. A settings form
#: writes config as it goes, so every step of it rebuilt the brain, killed the

#: modest machine that reads as the command freezing, and it is the same
#: process being started and torn down three or four times in a row.

    effort is spelled one way in config and another on the wire.

    provider — ``{name: [supported, note]}``, and ``{}`` for a profile whose
