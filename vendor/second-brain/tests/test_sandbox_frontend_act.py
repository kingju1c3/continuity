"""``frontend.act`` — a frontend acting as one of its own sessions.

A frontend box is rooted ``frontend:<name>``, which names no session, so
``attended_now`` answers False for it forever: every unsafe Request it makes is
refused rather than asked, because there is nobody a dialog could be drawn for.
That is right for a frontend acting on its own initiative and wrong for one
serving a request somebody just made, which is the whole reason a client could
only ever *read* through an HTTP frontend.

``act`` says so, by rooting one Request at a session the frontend owns. Three
properties are what these tests are for, and each was a real failure before it
was a rule:

* **It does not wait.** A box serves one call at a time, and an approval
  renders back *into the calling box* to be seen. Inline, that is a deadlock
  until the dialog expires — the same shape ``handlers.kernel._drive`` exists
  to prevent.
* **The authority is the session's, not the type's.** Rooting at the session
  makes attendance decide, and attendance is what this same frontend declared.
  Say nobody is watching and the authority goes away.
* **Ownership is host-side.** The token says which frontend is asking; the
  runtime's session tags say which sessions it may speak about. Both halves,
  or one frontend answers for another's user.
