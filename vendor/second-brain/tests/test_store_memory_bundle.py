"""What the kernel reads off the four files that make up memory.

Same shape as ``test_store_attachment_tools``: kernel invariants that happen to
be *about* store files. The subject is the kernel's own verdict — does this
load, are these Requests real, is the retrieval free of dialogs, can this reach
outside the folder — and the store file is the input.

The three matter together because each is useless alone, and they divide by
*when* rather than by verb. ``service_memory_retrieve`` ranks the corpus at
``turn_start``, injects descriptions and records what it offered.
``tool_memory`` is the only thing that touches the files — in either direction
— and records what was opened. ``task_memory_curate`` decides when a curator
runs. Two automatic halves and one agent-invoked one.

Reading and writing are one tool on purpose. They were two, whose
*declarations* were disjoint — the writer had no ``fs.read`` — and that bought
nothing a curator could not get through ``read_file`` one tool over, while
costing a revision the ability to keep a description it had just read. What
confines the tool is that it takes a name and derives every path itself, so the
tests below pin the character set and the two path templates rather than the
split.

What connects the three is not an import
but the *folder* and one table, so the things worth pinning are the
declarations that decide whether any of it runs at all: the hook moment, the
trigger channel, the default job, the shared constants, and the profile that
keeps the curator inside the folder.

Skips cleanly when no store ref is reachable.
