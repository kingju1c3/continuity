"""The templates teach the contract, so the contract checks the templates.

``agent/system_prompt_static.md`` tells the agent every turn that templates are
the source of truth for authoring each family. That makes them load-bearing
documentation: a template still teaching ``run(self, context)`` propagates the
old contract into every plugin written from it, and nothing would notice.

The examples inside them are therefore real, uncommented code, run through the
same validator a plugin faces. That is the whole point — commented-out examples
are what rotted last time, because nothing could check them.
