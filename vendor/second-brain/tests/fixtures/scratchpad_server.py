"""A persistent script with no plugin contract at all — a scratchpad server.

The module *is* the object: its functions are the methods, and its globals are
the state that survives between calls. This is what an agent gets when it
wants somewhere to keep working notes across a conversation, without any of
the plugin machinery.

Note it is persistent because the kernel opened a persistent box for it, not
because of anything written here. Nothing in this file could make it so.
