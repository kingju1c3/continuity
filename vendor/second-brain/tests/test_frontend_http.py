"""The HTTP frontend: the whole connection between an app and the kernel.

This is the HTTP frontend's conformance suite, and it matters more than a
frontend's usually would — nothing else is reachable from the client, so what
is not covered here is what an app silently cannot do.

The design it pins is deliberately thin. There are two surfaces:

* ``GET /events`` streams every ``render`` the kernel makes, **verbatim**. No
  mapping table, no protocol vocabulary, no message-id bookkeeping. A client
  that can read the eleven kinds can do what the REPL can — and more, since
  ``notification`` is a kind the REPL flattens back into chat.
* ``POST /sdk/<type>`` runs any Request, through ``frontend.act``, rooted at
  the session named by ``?thread=``. Nothing is allowlisted, because policy
  already decides — and an unsafe one raises a dialog that arrives on the very
  stream the client is holding.

Three things fail *quietly* when broken, so each has a test that says so out
loud: a render that is dropped rather than buffered, a route that skips the
bearer token, and a body that is allowed to name its own session.
