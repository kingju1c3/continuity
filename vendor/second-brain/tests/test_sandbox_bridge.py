"""The bridge: SDK code wearing a native face.

The claim under test is that a sandboxed plugin is indistinguishable from a
native one to everything downstream — discovery registers it, the registries
type-check it, the state machine calls it, and none of them learn where the
code actually runs.

This used to be a claim about *coexistence*, because the loader would fall
through to an ordinary import for a file that had not been migrated. That is
gone: the migration is over, and a plugin the bridge will not carry is a
plugin that does not load. ``NATIVE_TOOL`` survives here as the fixture for
what refusal looks like.
