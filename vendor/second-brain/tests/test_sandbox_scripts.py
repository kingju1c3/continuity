"""Scripts: SDK code the agent runs without it becoming a capability.

The point of a script is that it is the *cheap* thing to reach for. A shell
command is an OS process outside the boundary and is asked about every time; a
script is contained, every effect inside it arrives at the gate on its own, and
so running one costs no dialog. These pin the two halves of that bargain — the
containment that earns it, and the one case that still gets asked about.
