"""Parsers a plugin *declares* and the kernel loads into its box.

Image, audio, video and tabular parses produce live objects — a PIL image, a
numpy waveform, an open container, a DataFrame — and none of them can cross a
process boundary. For a long time that left sandboxed code with no route to a
heavy modality at all: ``sdk.parse.file`` refused them, and reaching the
kernel's registry directly is impossible from a box (the child runs with
``sandbox/`` as its cwd, so ``import parsing`` is a ``ModuleNotFoundError``).

The route is to move the parser rather than the result. A plugin declares
``parse_modalities``, the kernel resolves that against its live registry, and
the resolved *files* are imported into the plugin's own box before it runs.
``sdk.parse.file`` then calls one directly and the object never travels.

Two properties are the point, and both are tested here:

- **The kernel resolves, the box does not.** A modality is a fact about which
  parser packages are installed, which the box has no way to know. Naming a
  capability therefore cannot reach a file the kernel would not have offered.
- **Declaring tightens isolation.** The declaration is read before anything
  runs, so provisioning foreign code is visible to the isolation decision —
  unlike a relative import of a declared helper, which is not.
