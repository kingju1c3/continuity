"""``fs_writable_dirs``: where the user has opened the filesystem, and where
no list of theirs can reach.

The setting is the filesystem twin of ``net_allowed_hosts`` — a person deciding
what code may touch, kept in config so the code being decided about cannot
write it. What is worth testing is almost entirely the carve-out: the natural
value for this setting on a developer's machine is the folder they keep
projects in, and on this machine that folder contains Second Brain itself.

Most tests run against a **synthetic layout** — ``paths.ROOT_DIR`` and
``paths.DATA_DIR`` pointed inside ``tmp_path`` — so they describe the rule
rather than this checkout. ``_protected`` re-reads both from the module on
every call, which is what makes that possible. Two tests deliberately use the
real ones, because "the app protects *itself*" is the claim that matters and
a synthetic layout cannot make it.
