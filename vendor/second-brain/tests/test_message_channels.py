"""Which channel each population of text travels on, made executable.

``RuntimeResult.messages`` means the conversation and nothing else — the agent's
replies and the person's own words. A refusal is ``error``, an announcement is a
notification, and what a command answered with is ``callable_output``. That is
what lets a client draw a chat transcript from one field and put commands in a
panel of their own.

The rule has been broken three times, and every time the same way: a line that
was *about* a command was appended to ``messages`` because something downstream
happened to read ``messages``. "Back." and "Skipped." arrived in the transcript
whenever somebody used a settings form; "Cancelled." arrived whenever they
pressed its Cancel button; "Loaded conversation: X" was one dispatched action
away from doing the same. Each was found by eye, because nothing failed.

So these tests are structural rather than behavioural, in the style of
``test_kernel_boundary.py``: they pin the *complete set* of places that may write
to ``messages`` at all. A fourth writer fails here, which turns a straggler into
a deliberate one-line decision in this file instead of a line of chat nobody
said.
