"""The kernel boundary (CLAUDE.md's "one rule"), made executable.

Core code may lean on the plugin *substrate* — base classes, discovery, shared
path helpers, the command-registry adapter — and may hard-import **no** plugin
implementation at all. Everything else arrives by discovery, so installing or
uninstalling a package can never break the kernel.

It was two, then one, now none, and each step down worked the same way: the
*routing* moved into the kernel and the *implementations* became installable
helpers. Parsing went first (:mod:`parsing`), the LLM followed (:mod:`llm`),
and both times the boundary got narrower by adding kernel code — which is
worth remembering the next time this rule looks like it needs widening.

These tests AST-walk every core module (nothing is imported or executed) and
pin the complete set of ``plugins.*`` import edges, including lazy
function-local imports — a deferred import is still a hard dependency.
Widening the kernel then fails here, turning boundary drift into a deliberate
one-line decision in this file instead of an accident in commit #601.
