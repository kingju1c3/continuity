"""The agent-text dump keeps pointing at real code.

``dev/dump_agent_text.py`` reads a curated list of kernel modules, because
"does this string reach a model" cannot be decided from the source and a
whole-tree scan buries the twenty sentences that matter under several hundred
log lines. Curation buys precision and costs drift: rename or move one of
those modules and the dump keeps working, keeps looking complete, and silently
stops showing a whole population.

That is the failure worth a test — not the formatting. A person editing the
agent's voice cannot tell the difference between "this text does not exist"
and "this file moved", and the dump exists precisely to be trusted on that
question.
