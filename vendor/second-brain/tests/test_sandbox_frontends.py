"""The frontend Requests, and the desk a token reaches.

A frontend is the one family that acts *for a person*: it says "someone typed
this" and the kernel believes it. So the security question is not what the
Request asks for but **which frontend is asking**, and the answer is
structural — a token parked when the box opened, resolving to that frontend's
own adapter and nothing else.

These tests are about that scoping. Rendering and the poll loop belong to the
bridge and are tested with it.
