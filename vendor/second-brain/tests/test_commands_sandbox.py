"""Every kernel command, checked as a family rather than one file at a time.

This replaces fourteen ``test_command_<name>_sandbox.py`` files that each
rigged a bespoke context to run one command and assert its exact output
string. That shape cost a full test file per command, broke on any wording
change, and still only covered whichever branch its author happened to rig.

What actually needs pinning is the same for all of them, and it is structural:
a migrated command must validate clean, adapt into something discovery will
register, and declare only Requests that exist. Behaviour that is genuinely
worth a test belongs with the *mechanism* it exercises (approval gating in
``test_command_approval_declarations``, mid-run asking in
``test_command_can_ask_mid_run``, the Request handlers themselves in the
``test_sandbox_*`` suite), not with the command that happened to trip over it.
