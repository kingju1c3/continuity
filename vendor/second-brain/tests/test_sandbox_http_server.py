"""A listening port: the kernel accepts, the guest drains.

``socket`` is refused to a guest and ``sdk.net.http`` dials *out*, so a
frontend could talk to the world and never be talked to. That is fine for a
transport which polls somebody else's servers and impossible for one a client
connects to — which is every protocol where the UI opens the connection, an
SSE render stream included. This suite is the argument that inverting it, exactly as the console
inverts stdin, closes the gap without widening what a guest may reach.

The inversion buys the same testability the console's does: the listener takes
any iterator of ``(request, responder)`` pairs, so most of this needs no
socket. The cases that are *about* the socket use one on an ephemeral port.
