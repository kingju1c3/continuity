"""The guest boundary, pinned executably.

``sandbox/guest/`` must stay self-contained: stdlib-only, importing nothing
from the host and nothing from the wider repo. Two things depend on it —

1. **Security.** If guest code can import ``sandbox.handlers`` it can call a
   handler directly and skip the gate entirely.
2. **Containers.** The guest is the shippable unit. An image copies that
   directory alone, so anything it reaches outside itself is a file that would
   have to ship too.

This is the sandbox's counterpart to ``test_kernel_boundary.py``: widening the
boundary fails the suite until the allowlist here is changed deliberately.
