# ── db.write: kernel rows are data, kernel schemas are structure ──────
#
# The line here moved once, and the reason is worth keeping. It used to be
# "kernel tables are not writable at all", argued from ``db.write`` being a way
# around ``conv.delete``'s dialog. What that actually blocked was bookkeeping:
# not every kernel *column* has a Request behind it, so a task maintaining one
# had to mirror rows it could already read into a shadow table. Meanwhile the
# integrity fear was unfounded — ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` plus
# ``PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON`` means raw SQL cascades exactly as ``conv.delete``
# does, that being a bare DELETE itself.
#
# So: data is writable, structure is not, and the one irreversible data write
# is asked about rather than refused.
