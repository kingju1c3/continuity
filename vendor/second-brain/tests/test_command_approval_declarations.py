"""Every command that declares a consequential Request declares a gate for it.

A command's ``requests`` list is what one "yes" buys. The state machine is
what *asks*, and it only asks when the command declares ``require_approval``
or an ``approval_actions``/``approval_action_prefixes`` predicate. Declare the
capability and not the gate and the command runs ungranted: no dialog before
the body, and the Request falls through mid-run to the execution-time
approver.

That fallback path is real and now works, but it is the wrong shape for a
command — it interrupts a half-finished operation with a question about a
Request the user has no context for, where the up-front grant states the whole
scope before anything happens. ``/packages install`` shipped with exactly this
gap, and while it was open it deadlocked the process.

One test rather than one per command, and the consequential set is *derived*
from the policy rather than restated, so a Request added to it tomorrow is
covered here without anyone remembering to come back. That derivation now
reads ``policy.CONSEQUENTIAL`` rather than assembling its own from
``ALWAYS_UNSAFE`` plus three hand-listed branches — which is how ``task.reset``
slipped past it for as long as it did: unsafe for every argument, but spelled
as a branch, so a set-membership derivation could not see it.
