"""``sdk.path`` — pure path arithmetic, and the reasons it stays pure.

Guest code cannot import ``pathlib`` or ``os.path``; both reach the
environment and the validator refuses them. But joining and splitting a path
is *computation*, and by the SDK's own test (does it touch disk, network,
clock, or process?) that makes it a helper rather than a Request. These pin
the behaviour, and — more importantly — the two things it deliberately will
not do.
