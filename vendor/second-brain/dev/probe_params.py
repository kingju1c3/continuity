"""What a profile's provider parameters actually become on the wire.

A backend does not forward a parameter, it *translates* it, and LiteLLM
decides how from the **model name** — so one string, chosen to name a model,
silently decides what an endpoint receives:

* a name whose first path segment matches a provider LiteLLM knows gets that
  provider's dialect (``deepseek/…`` sends ``thinking={"type": "enabled"}``,
  ``ollama/…`` sends ``think=True``) — addressed to whatever host the
  profile's endpoint actually points at, which is very often not that
  provider. An endpoint that has never heard of the field answers 400.
* anything else goes through as written.

The third outcome used to be *dropped*: LiteLLM's ``drop_params`` discards a
parameter its table does not list for the resolved provider, and that table
has gaps — it omits ``reasoning_effort`` for MiniMax, whose own API documents
it. The backend now passes ``allowed_openai_params`` for everything a profile
sends, so a configured value reaches the provider even if the provider then
refuses it. This probe does the same, which is why DROPPED should no longer
appear; if it does, the backend and this file have drifted.

None of it is visible from ``/llm``'s own screen, and the failure of the first
is whatever the endpoint says — measured against one aggregator, the entire
refusal was ``{'code': 400, 'msg': 'bad request'}``.

Offline by default: no key is used, nothing is sent, and the answer comes from
the same LiteLLM translation the backend will perform. ``--live`` adds one
real five-token call per profile, which is the only way to see the endpoint's
own verdict on what we would send it.

    python dev/probe_params.py                       # every configured profile
    python dev/probe_params.py --profile minimax/MiniMax-M3
    python dev/probe_params.py --live                # +1 tiny call per profile

Run it on the deployment that shows the symptom — the endpoint and the model
name are both part of the question, so the answer is allowed to differ per
machine.
