"""Who is asking, carried across a Request that re-enters the sandbox.

The design argument — why the chain has to be a stack, why it is ambient
rather than a parameter, and why the token reset is load-bearing — lives in
CLAUDE.md under "The chain only became a stack once it could survive
re-entry". One home for it; this module is the mechanism.

The value carries the host context alongside the chain because both answer
"who is asking", one link apart: a service called from a session reads that
person's rows, a service acting on its own reads the kernel's.

    starts nested work and then blocks waiting for it — ``script.run`` is the
    case — is not making Requests while it waits, so cancelling the caller sets
    a flag nobody reads and the nested work runs to its own ceiling. Handlers

        A starved box never resumes, so whatever the handler would have said
        arrives nowhere and the caller is left with the runner's generic
