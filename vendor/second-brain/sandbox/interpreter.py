"""The drive loop — the kernel side of the sandbox.

This is the whole architecture; everything else hangs off it. Sandboxed code
runs somewhere it cannot act (a worker thread now, a subprocess later) and
sends Requests here. The interpreter classifies each one, executes the allowed
ones, and hands the result back so the code resumes.

**The servicer is split in two, deliberately.** Classification is serial — one
gate thread, so provenance and policy have a single ordering point — but
execution is not. A plugin's 30-second HTTP call is dispatched to a pool, so it
never blocks anyone else's classification. Concurrency is cheap here;
*granularity* is what costs, which is why the SDK offers batch forms.

**Asking the user leaves the gate for the same reason, only more so.** A
dialog is drawn by a frontend, and a frontend reaches the kernel only through
Requests that arrive at this gate — so asking on the gate thread meant the
question could never be shown and the answer could never be read.

Cancellation works by starvation. A thread cannot be killed, but every effect
must pass through this loop, so refusing to service a cancelled execution's
Requests stops it doing anything at its very next Request.

    An answer that cannot cross is not an answer, and this is the one funnel
    every serviced Request passes through — so checking here is what makes the
    guarantee kernel-wide instead of per-handler. Both runners inherit it:
    in-process, the oversized value would have raised out of
    ``Result.crossing``; over a pipe, ``protocol.encode`` raises inside
    ``runner_subprocess.send``, which catches only ``OSError``/``ValueError``
    and therefore let a ``ProtocolError`` escape the serve loop and take a
    resident box down with it.

    **Substituting beats raising**, because the caller is a plugin that asked
    an ordinary question and a fault is not an ordinary answer to one. It is
    the same move ``guest/child.py:_send_result`` already makes on its side of
    the wire, and the same reasoning ``handlers/fs_net`` uses to cap a read
    rather than let it become "a crash-shaped answer to an ordinary request".

    The cost is one ``json.dumps`` per Request, ~3 microseconds on a typical
    result. It is not new: both paths already serialized every result — the
    in-process one in ``InterpreterChannel.send``, the subprocess one in
    ``send`` — so this moves the encode earlier rather than adding one, and
    ``InterpreterChannel`` no longer repeats it.

    Note what this does **not** do: it never truncates. A handler that can
    answer a large question in pieces has to say so in its own vocabulary —
    ``conv.read`` pages, ``fs.read`` caps, ``db.query`` limits rows — because
    only the handler knows what half an answer would mean. This is the
