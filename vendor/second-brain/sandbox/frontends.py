"""The two-way translation for frontends, and the desk a token reaches.

A frontend is the only family that acts *for a person*. Everything else in the
sandbox asks the kernel to do something on its own account; a frontend says
"someone typed this" — and the kernel believes it, because believing the
frontend is what a frontend is for. That makes "which frontend is asking?" the
whole security question, and it is answered structurally rather than by policy.

**The desk.** When a frontend's box opens, its adapter is parked here under a
one-shot token and the token is handed into the box. Every ``sdk.frontend.*``
Request carries it back, and the handler reaches *that adapter and no other*.
Code holding no token — a tool, a service, a script — resolves to nothing and
is refused. So a frontend cannot submit on another frontend's behalf, cannot
bind a session it does not own, and cannot outlive its own box: the desk is
cleared at stop, and a leaked token then reaches nothing.

This is the same move ``sandbox/hooks.py`` makes for an escort's ``proceed``,
with one difference worth naming. An escort's phone is parked for the duration
of *one doorway visit*, because that is how long the call it refers to exists.
A frontend's desk lasts as long as its box, because a frontend is not visiting
anything — it is resident, and its authority is its identity rather than a
moment.

**Rendering is a projection.** ``BaseFrontend`` hands its subclasses live
kernel objects; a box can only be handed data, so the thirteen ``render_*``
methods collapse to one ``render(kind, payload)`` call here — and a guest that
only understands ``messages`` is still a working frontend.
