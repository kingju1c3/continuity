"""Secret handles — using a credential you are never allowed to read.

The database is not where the secrets are. ``users.password_hash`` is the only
secret column in the schema; the real ones are API keys and OAuth tokens in
config and the environment. So this is the mechanism the security contract's
"private information" clause actually needs, and it sits on ``config.read``
and ``env.read``, not on ``db.query``.

A Request that would return a credential returns an opaque handle instead::

    key = sdk.config.read("brave_api_key").data     # "<secret:brave_api_key>"
    sdk.net.http(url, headers={"X-Key": key})       # kernel swaps it back

Sandboxed code can therefore *use* a credential it can never *read*, which is
exactly the property a careless plugin needs: it cannot leak a key it was
never given, cannot log one by accident, and cannot include one in an error
message.

Substitution happens on the way out, inside the handler, after the policy
function has already decided. A handle is meaningless anywhere else — it is
just a string, and one that does not resolve is left exactly as it is rather
than being silently blanked, so a mistake looks like a mistake.

**Named ``credentials`` and not ``secrets`` on purpose.** A subprocess box runs
with ``sandbox/`` as its cwd, so every top-level module here is importable in
the child under its bare name — and a file called ``secrets.py`` shadowed the
stdlib ``secrets`` for the whole guest process. Nothing in the sandbox imports
it, which is why it went unnoticed; litellm does, and every model call died on
``module 'secrets' has no attribute 'token_hex'``. ``tests/
test_sandbox_guest_boundary.py`` now refuses any stdlib-shadowing name here.
