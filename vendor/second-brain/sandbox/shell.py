"""Shell commands: what one will run, and what may run unasked.

Split out of :mod:`sandbox.policy` because it stopped being a branch and became
a subject. ``classify`` decides one thing about a Request from its type,
arguments and chain; this answers a harder question that only the shell family
asks — *what commands does this line actually run* — and then applies two
recognizers to the answer.

**Everything is asked by default.** Why there is no classifier deciding
*safety* here, and why there must not be one again, is in CLAUDE.md under "And
it is where the classifier died": the old one decomposed a command line with a
regex and then ruled on each piece, which is undecidable in principle and fails
in the invisible direction — a wrong "unsafe" gets reported by the user, a
wrong "safe" does not.

What replaced it decides a *different* question. A **recognizer** returns a
reason to allow a command, or ``None`` to stay out of the way, so it can only
ever widen and a bug costs a dialog rather than a breach. Two ship:

- ``_read_only_command`` — structural. It works only because it refuses to be
  complete: deciding *every* command is Rice's theorem, deciding a few and
  abstaining on the rest is trivial.
- ``_remembered_prefix`` — what a person answered "always" to in an approval
  dialog, persisted in ``shell_allowed_prefixes`` where the policy can see it
  rather than inside the plugin it authorizes.

Both ask about **coverage**, never safety, and both derive their unit through
:func:`command_prefix` — so a grant is stored and matched in one vocabulary,
the same way :func:`render_command` is shared by the dialog and the ledger row.

Adding a third recognizer is a deliberate widening of the authorization
surface, which is what the length of this docstring is for.

# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The read-only recognizer.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# This is the classifier's second attempt, and the difference is entirely in
# what it refuses to attempt. The one that died tried to decide *every*
# command: split the line at unquoted ``&&``/``||``/``;``/``|``, match each
# segment against a whitelist of program names, send redirection and
# substitution to approval. Deciding an arbitrary command line is Rice's
# theorem, and it failed in the invisible direction — a wrong "unsafe" gets
# reported, a wrong "safe" does not.
#
# Deciding *a few* commands and abstaining on everything else is not the same
# problem, and it is trivial. Three rules keep it that way:
#
#   1. **Abstain, never deny.** A recognizer returns a reason or ``None``; it
#      has no authority to say "unsafe" because nothing needs it to. A bug
#      here costs a dialog. That is the shape ``_SHELL_RECOGNIZERS`` already
#      had, and it is what makes the rest of this safe to write at all.
#
#   2. **The unit is (program, subcommand).** ``git`` is not read-only;
#      ``git status`` is. ``find`` is read-only right up until ``-exec``.
#      A whitelist keyed on the program name is wrong at the root, which is
#      most of why the first one could not be fixed.
#
#   3. **No parsing.** Any shell at all, any metacharacter anywhere, and this
#      abstains without looking further. It reads the *structured* argv and
#      not the rendered line, because the rendered line is precisely the thing
#      that cannot be reasoned about — quoting, ``$(...)``, backticks, aliases
#      and ``eval`` all beat a parser, so there is no parser.
#
# What it buys is the high-frequency, zero-information prompts: a person
# clicking through ``git status`` forty times a day is being trained not to
# read dialogs, and that training is what the one dialog that mattered will
# run into. What it deliberately never covers is anything that runs arbitrary
# code by design — ``npm install``, ``pip install``, ``pytest``, ``make``,
# ``python script.py``. Those are the minority by count and the majority by
# consequence, and they stay asked forever.
#
# **Sound against carelessness, not against a hostile repository.** Even
# ``git diff`` can invoke an external diff driver named by a repo's
# ``.gitattributes``. That is the documented threat model (see the security
# contract), and it is the line this sits on.

#: Argv elements containing any of these abstain. With ``shell=None`` the
#: handler executes the list as given, so none of them can actually *do*
#: anything — but an argv carrying one was written by somebody who expected a
#: shell, and abstaining on that costs a dialog and settles it.
_SHELL_METACHARACTERS = frozenset("|&;<>$`()\n\r")

#: ``(program, subcommand) -> (allowed_flags, positionals_ok)``. A subcommand
#: of ``""`` means the program takes none. An unknown flag abstains, which is
#: what keeps this a whitelist rather than a deny list.
#:
#: ``positionals_ok`` exists because a bare word means opposite things to
#: neighbouring verbs: to ``git log`` it is a ref or a path to read, to
#: ``git branch`` it is a branch to *create*. Allowing free positionals
#: everywhere would have let ``git remote add origin <url>`` through, which is
#: the concrete bug that makes the pair the right unit.
#:
#: Deliberately absent, each for a reason worth keeping written down:
#:   - ``pytest --collect-only`` — collection *imports* every test module, so
#:     module-level code runs. It looks inert and is not.
#:   - ``find`` — read-only until ``-exec``, and ``-exec`` is a flag.
#:   - ``git config`` — sets exactly as readily as it gets.
#:
#: ``cat`` and ``ls`` were once on that list, on the argument that
#: ``sdk.fs.read`` and ``sdk.fs.list`` do the same thing mediated and that a
#: dialog is the right nudge toward the SDK. They are handled below instead —
#: not by an entry here, because this table decides on *flags* and those two
#: turn on their *operands*. ``_read_only_cat`` admits only the files
#: ``fs.read`` would have handed over anyway (:func:`~sandbox.protected.
#: reason_for`, a regular file, the same size cap), so it grants no reach the
#: SDK did not already have — it removes a dialog, not a boundary.
