"""Asking the user — the sandbox's approver, wired to the kernel's doorway.

The policy function decides *whether* to ask. This decides *how*, and it
deliberately reuses machinery the kernel already has rather than growing a
second permission system beside it:

1. **``vet_permission`` hooks first.** The kernel already has a doorway where
   policy plugins stand — plan mode refuses everything there, and a trust
   plugin could allow. A gate that has an opinion wins; every gate abstaining
   falls through.
2. **The dialog.** ``runtime.request_input`` renders it, and its options are
   where a "yes" can be kept — see :mod:`sandbox.options`.
3. **Nobody home.** An unattended session refuses rather than blocking, which
   is the kernel's own default when every gate abstains at the
   ``unattended_call`` stage.

There was a step between 1 and 2: ``skip_permissions``, a user-scoped list of
plugin *names* whose dialogs were auto-approved. It was the only durable
answer the system had, which is why its unit had to be that broad — trusting
``web_search`` trusted every host it would ever reach, forever, through any
service it called. Now that an answer can be kept at the grain the question
was asked at, a whole-plugin bypass is strictly worse than the thing it was
standing in for, so it is gone rather than left as a blunter option.

The dialog is built from the chain, not the leaf. "service_web wants to make
an HTTP request" is a question nobody can answer; "the summarize tool you just
ran wants to POST to example.com" can be answered in a second. That is the
whole reason provenance exists, and this is the only place it is shown.

    thing separating a foreground turn from a subagent's. The runtime's reader
    answers the rest. Neither half is sufficient alone, and the whole of it is
    :func:`policy.attended_now`.

    It was once the other way round, and the consequence was ugly.
    ``is_attended`` won whenever a session key existed, and ``build_approver``
    is wired with none (``runtime/bootstrap.py``), so the key fell back to
    ``active_session_key`` — trivially attended, by definition. An unsafe
    Request from a scheduled subagent therefore raised a dialog on the
    foreground session, pushing it into ``approving_request``, where the only
    legal actions are answering or cancelling. Every ordinary keystroke came
    back ``invalid_action``, once per firing, about work the person could not
    see and had never started.

    The correction was ``chain.attended`` as a hard floor, which overshot in
    the other direction: that property is True only for a root of ``user``,
    and an agent's own tool call roots at the session key instead. So every
    unsafe Request any tool made was refused without a dialog, in a session
    the person was watching. Handing the chain's *root* to ``is_attended``
    restores both cases at once — a subagent's root is a session key that is
    not the active one, so it still approves nothing.

    ``sandbox/policy.py`` rests the safety of ``agent.spawn`` on that.
