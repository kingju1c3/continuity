"""The validation script — a conformance linter, not a security boundary.

It reads a plugin file with :mod:`ast` and never imports it, so checking a file
cannot run it. What it catches is *carelessness*: reaching for the environment
directly instead of asking, declaring a name that already exists, breaking the
plugin contract. That is the whole threat model — an agent with good intentions
and no judgement.

**It cannot be perfect and does not need to be.** Static analysis of Python is
defeatable by anyone trying (``getattr(__builtins__, "op" + "en")`` and a dozen
cousins), which is why the subprocess exists. Against code that is merely
thoughtless, a linter with good error messages is the right tool — and the
error messages are the point. Every finding names the Request that should have
been used, because the feedback loop is what makes the constraint teachable
instead of a wall the agent keeps walking into.

Three severities:

- ``ERROR``   — will not load. A direct effect, or a broken contract.
- ``WARNING`` — loads with a disclaimer. A foreign library cannot be validated
  (it may be binary, or not Python at all), so its actions cannot be turned
  into Requests. Subprocess it and say so.
- ``NOTE``    — advisory. The file loads and runs exactly as written; something
  about it is probably not what was meant. A declared value above the kernel's
  ceiling still works, it just gets clamped; a setting named like a credential
  but not declared as one hands over plaintext; a command pushing its output
  into the chat puts it somewhere the author did not intend.

``NOTE`` earns its place by covering the mistakes that are **invisible from
outside**. A wrong ``poll_interval`` fails loudly and a direct effect does not
load at all, but a plugin handing over a plaintext secret, or a command
narrating into the transcript, behaves perfectly and looks right when tried —
the REPL flattens every render kind into one, so the channel a line travelled
on cannot be seen from a terminal at all. Advisory is not the same as minor.
