"""The front door — one API for running anything under the sandbox.

Underneath there are three mechanisms (a thread runner, a process runner, and
resident boxes) with three different shapes. Callers should not have to know
which one they are using: whether code is isolated, how long it may take, and
whether it stays resident are all *declarations in the file*, resolved here.

So one call does the whole sequence:

    validate -> read declarations -> resolve the box -> clamp -> pick a runner

If a file will not pass validation it is never executed, and the bytes that
were validated are the bytes that run — the report carries them, so a file
that changes in between was never checked.

Two lifetimes, three entry points:

- :meth:`Sandbox.run` — ephemeral, blocking. Returns a Result.
- :meth:`Sandbox.start` — ephemeral, non-blocking. Returns a :class:`Run` to
  wait on, poll, or cancel later. This is the ``wait=False`` shape: a tool
  that spawns background work returns immediately while the work continues.
- :meth:`Sandbox.open` — resident. Returns a box to call into until stopped.

Every box the sandbox opens is tracked, so :meth:`Sandbox.shutdown` can close
them all. An untracked resident box is an orphaned process after a restart.
