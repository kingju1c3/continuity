"""What a person may answer an approval dialog with, and what it remembers.

:mod:`sandbox.approval` answers *how* we ask. This answers *what may be said*,
and — the part that makes it worth its own module — it is the only code in the
sandbox that **writes config**, and now the only code that sets a security
mode. That is safe for exactly one reason: what it writes is a person's own
answer to a question the kernel asked. Guest code never reaches this; a plugin
cannot propose an option, and the dialog cannot be reached without the policy
having already refused the Request.

Every "allow once" used to be thrown away. The only durable grant was
``skip_permissions``, whose unit was a *plugin name* — trusting ``web_search``
trusted every host it would ever reach, forever, through any service it
called. It is gone; these replaced it. The lists here are narrower and the
person edits them the same way they read them, with ``/config``, which is the
whole reason these live in config rather than in the database: an approval
nobody can enumerate is one nobody can withdraw.

#
# ``builder(chain, request, decision) -> list[Option]``. Every builder is asked
# about every dialog and answers with options it can *make good on*, or
# nothing. Deliberately the same shape as ``shell._SHELL_RECOGNIZERS``, and
# for the same three reasons:
#
#   1. **Abstain, never assert.** A builder returns options or ``[]``. It has
#      no say in whether the Request is allowed — that was settled by
#      ``classify`` before anything here ran. A bug costs an option.
#   2. **A raiser abstains**, logged and skipped, so one bad builder cannot
#      take the dialog down with it.
#   3. **Never offer what cannot work.** An option writing to a list the policy
#      would then refuse to honour — a folder inside the app's own tree, say —
#      is worse than no option at all: it is a grant the person believes they
#      made. Builders check before offering.
#
# Adding "Always trust this tool" or "Deny forever" is an entry in this list
# and a function beside it. It is not a branch in ``build_approver``.
#
# Three of the four ship the same thing one layer down — they turn "yes" into
# an entry in a list the user keeps — so each is really only two questions:
# what is the grantable unit here, and is it already granted.
#
# ``_rest_of_this_turn`` is the fourth and it is the proof the opaque
# ``remember`` closure was worth having: its unit is **time**, so it writes to
# the session rather than to config, and neither ``options_for`` nor the dialog
# had to learn that it was different.

    session too, with a person right there watching, and no turn anywhere.

    That is the second question, and it is rule 3 rather than tidiness. The
    grant is dropped by ``HookRegistry.finish_turn``, so offered outside a turn
    it expires at the end of the *next* one — whenever the person happens to
    send a message and the agent happens to finish replying. A yolo window of
    unstated length, opened by a button that stated a short one. Better no
    option than a grant whose scope is not the one the person read.

    Not offered when the turn is already running in ``yolo``, since the button
