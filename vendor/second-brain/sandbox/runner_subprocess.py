"""Subprocess execution — the same code, the same SDK, a harder boundary.

The parent pumps messages: read a Request, hand it to the *same*
:class:`~sandbox.interpreter.Interpreter` the in-process runner uses, write
the Result back. One gate, one policy function, one ledger, two runners.

What differs from in-process is only enforcement. A thread cannot be killed,
so in-process cancellation works by starvation; a process can, so here a
runaway is actually stopped. See :mod:`sandbox.child` for what this boundary
does and does not buy — notably, it is not filesystem isolation yet.

Entry is by *file path and function name*, not a callable: a function defined
in a local scope cannot cross a process boundary. Real plugins are files, so
this is the production shape anyway.
