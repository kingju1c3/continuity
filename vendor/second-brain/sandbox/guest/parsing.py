"""The parser contract — what a ``parse_*.py`` helper returns.

This lives in the guest because a parser is *guest code*. It runs inside a
box, alongside whatever consumes its output, and the shape it hands back is
part of what a plugin author writes against — the same reason
:mod:`guest.bases` and :mod:`guest.hooks` are here rather than in the kernel.

The practical consequence is the whole reason it moved: a parser importing a
kernel module loads in-process and fails in a subprocess, which is the case
the heavy parsers most need. Importing the contract from the guest resolves
identically in both. (CLAUDE.md, "The contract lives in the guest".)

A parser is::

    def parse_x(sdk, path, config=None) -> ParseResult

One signature, two callers. Inside a box ``sdk`` is the real SDK and every
effect is a Request; when the kernel calls it, ``sdk`` is an in-process
stand-in that reads directly. The parser cannot tell, and does not need to.

Stdlib only, like everything else in here.

    The first modality declared for an extension becomes its default, so
    order matters: a PDF that declares text before image is text by default.

    ``generic`` says this parser is the *fallback* for an extension rather
    than its specialist -- it reads the file's own bytes and tidies them,
    rather than knowing a format. Exactly one parser sets it (the kernel's
    ``parse_text``), and the point of saying so is that a caller holding a
    path can then tell "this file's text is its content" from "this file's
    content is somewhere else".

    That distinction is not visible any other way. ``parse_text`` registers
    ``.py`` as text and ``parse_gdoc`` registers ``.gdoc`` as text, so the
    modality is the same word for a source file and for a Drive shortcut
    whose body has to be fetched over the network. A tool routing on modality
    alone reads the shortcut's JSON and calls it the document.

    Defaulting to ``False`` is what makes that safe: a parser that says
    nothing is a specialist, so a new format is routed to its parser without
    its author having to know this flag exists. The failure it prevents is
    silent, and the default is the safe end of it.
