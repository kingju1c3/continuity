"""The Request vocabulary — what sandboxed code may ask the kernel to do.

A Request is an inert, serializable description of a desired effect. It is
never a callable and never holds a live object, so the same value crosses a
thread boundary (in-process runner) or a pipe (subprocess runner) unchanged.

Everything that touches disk, network, clock, or process is a Request.
Everything else belongs in the SDK and never reaches the kernel.

The catalogue below is the complete list of what any plugin can ever do, and
is documented family by family in ``docs/SECURITY_CONTRACT_APPENDIX.md``.

        word "denied" was taken for a policy refusal. That made a handler
        reporting ``"denied by the remote host"`` raise :class:`Denied` in
        guest code, so a web server's refusal was indistinguishable from the
        kernel's. Every refusal is minted by :meth:`refusal`, which supplies a
        code, so nothing needs the prefix any more — it stays in the text only
        so a person reading the sentence still sees the word.
