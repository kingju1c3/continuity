"""Why a Request failed, in a form code can branch on.

A ``Result`` carries a sentence, and a sentence is for a person. Anything that
has to *decide* something needs a token, and until this module existed there
was exactly one, encoded as a prefix on the sentence: ``Result.denied`` asked
whether ``error`` started with the word "denied". That works right up until a
handler reports ``"denied by the remote host"``, at which point a web server's
refusal is indistinguishable from the kernel's and guest code catches
``sdk.Denied`` for it.

So the signal moves onto its own field. The names follow
``state_machine/errors.py``, which had the same problem and solved it the same
way; ``guest/llm.py`` already puts an ``error_code`` on ``LLMResponse`` and
crosses the wire with it.

**An empty code is not a bug.** Most failures are read by a person and never
branched on, and a code invented for one of those is decoration that has to be
kept accurate forever. Add one when a *second* reader appears — that is the
rule that keeps this a vocabulary rather than a rename of 166 call sites.

**``retryable`` stays orthogonal.** A timeout is usually worth retrying and a
bad argument never is, but the flag is set deliberately by whoever knows, not
derived from the code. ``runner_subprocess`` already pairs a timeout with
``retryable=True``; nothing should start inferring one from the other.
