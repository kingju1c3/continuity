"""The child half of a subprocessed sandbox — ``python -m guest.child``.

Reads a ``start`` message, imports the target file, runs the function with an
SDK bound to the pipe, and reports a ``done``. It holds no interpreter, no
queues, and no threads: it writes a Request and blocks on a pipe read, which
is why the plugin code above it cannot tell which runner it is on.

**What this boundary does and does not buy.** A separate process gives
killability (a runaway can actually be stopped, unlike a thread), crash
containment, and — on POSIX — memory and CPU ceilings via ``setrlimit``. It
does *not* restrict which files the child may open: it runs as the same user
with the same permissions. Genuine filesystem isolation needs a container, an
AppContainer, or a separate account with ACLs, and that is a later step. Do
not describe this mode as full isolation until that lands.
