"""The guest's transport — how sandboxed code reaches the kernel.

The guest has exactly one way out: write a Request, block, read a Result. No
queues, no threads, no interpreter. Whatever is on the other end of the two
streams — a pipe today, a container socket later — is not the guest's concern,
which is what makes the same plugin code run unchanged under every runner.

The host has its own in-process channel (see ``sandbox.interpreter``). Both
satisfy the same two-method shape: ``send`` and ``log``.
