"""The LLM backend contract — what a ``llm_*.py`` helper is handed and returns.

This lives in the guest for the same reason :mod:`guest.parsing` does: a
backend is *guest code*, running with a foreign SDK and a network connection,
which is precisely what is least worth trusting in-process. A backend
importing a kernel module would load in-process and die in a subprocess.

A backend is a class::

    class MyBackend(BaseLLMBackend):
        def chat(self, sdk, request: LLMRequest) -> LLMResponse

A class rather than a function because a backend is a *residency*: the
imported provider library living on the instance is what "loaded" means, and
loading it is the expensive part nobody wants to repeat per call. But it is
stateless with respect to the *profile* — every model name, key and endpoint
arrives on the request — which is what lets the kernel keep a pool of
interchangeable boxes for one model.

Three things cross, and all three are plain data:

- :class:`LLMRequest` in,
- :class:`LLMResponse` out,
- text deltas, pushed one at a time through ``sdk.llm.delta``.

Nothing else. In particular there is no ``on_delta`` callback, and the abort
boolean it used to return is gone rather than ported — see CLAUDE.md,
"Streaming inverted, and lost a feature on purpose".

Stdlib only, like everything else in here.

        ``name`` is the string **this backend wants to be handed back** in

        ends up unreachable for want of five characters.

        ``live`` is permission to *ask the endpoint*, and it defaults to off.
        A listing fetched from the server is the better answer — current, and
        it covers gateways no table has heard of — but fetching it is egress,

        lock it is already holding.

        ``description`` and ``note`` answer different questions and both are
