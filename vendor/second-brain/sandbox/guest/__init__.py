"""The guest side of the sandbox — everything that runs *inside* the boundary.

This package is self-contained and stdlib-only. It knows the Request
vocabulary, the wire format, the SDK, and the plugin contracts, and it knows
nothing about the gate, the policy function, or the handlers. That is the
point: guest code physically cannot reach the kernel's decision-making,
because it is not importable from here.

It is also the shippable unit. A container image copies this directory and
nothing else, and runs ``python -m guest.child``. Because the modules are
relative-imported within the package, ``guest`` works equally as a top-level
package (in an image) or as ``sandbox.guest`` (in the repo).

**A base class is optional.** Plugins subclass one so the kernel can register
and schedule them, but the sandbox runs any file with functions that take
``sdk`` — an agent's scratch computation, a helper module, a one-off script.
Nothing here is required to compute.

The host imports *from* here — the Request vocabulary and wire format are
shared. Nothing here imports back.
