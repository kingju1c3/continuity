"""The plugin contracts, rewritten for the Requests system.

These live in the guest because every plugin subclasses one, so they are part
of the shippable SDK rather than of the kernel. A container image copies
``guest/`` and has everything a plugin needs to be written against.

The one difference that produced all the others: a plugin no longer receives a
bag of live kernel objects, it receives a handle that can only ask. What that
changes per family — the common ancestor, box membership, ``exports`` — is the
subject of ``docs/MIGRATING_PLUGINS.md``.

**None of this is required to use the sandbox.** An arbitrary script — an
agent's scratch computation, a helper module — needs no base class and no
declaration at all. It is a file with functions that take ``sdk``. The classes
here exist to describe things the *kernel* has to register and schedule; code
that only wants to compute should ignore them.

Every attribute is a declaration of *intent*. The kernel reads them without
importing the file, resolves them, and clamps them. Declaring a longer timeout
or a wider box does not grant one.
