"""Resident boxes — sandboxed code the kernel calls into repeatedly.

An ephemeral box *is* its call: run, answer, gone. A resident one is loaded
once and then waits, holding whatever state it acquired — a model, a
connection, a scratchpad's globals — while the kernel calls in.

**Persistence is decided before the code runs.** It is a property of the box,
resolved from declarations, never something code can drift into by refusing to
finish. A script that never returns in an ephemeral box is not persistent; it
is a runaway, and it times out. Nothing can promote itself to unlimited
lifetime by hanging.

**One call at a time.** Every box serializes: a lock per box, one call in
flight. That is what lets the wire protocol work without message ids, and it
matches how a loaded service behaves anyway.

**Ending a box is the kernel's decision**, escalating through three tiers:

===========  =========================================  ==========  ==========
Tier         Mechanism                                  in-process  subprocess
===========  =========================================  ==========  ==========
``ask``      ``stop`` message; ``stop()`` runs; exit    yes         yes
``starve``   refuse every Request; code unwinds at its  yes         yes
             next one
``kill``     terminate the process                      no          yes
===========  =========================================  ==========  ==========

Starvation is the tier that works everywhere, and it works *because* every
effect goes through the gate: code that cannot act cannot resist being shut
down. The honest gap is a pure compute loop that makes no Requests — nothing
short of ``kill`` reaches that, and in-process there is no ``kill``.

        If a caller is on this thread — a sandboxed tool that reached us
        through ``service.call``, say — the box answers *as* that caller for
        the duration: its chain descends from the caller's rather than
        starting beside it, and its Requests are answered from the caller's
        world rather than the kernel's. Serialization is what makes swapping
        live state safe here; one call is in flight at a time by construction.

        A call with no caller — a poll tick, a bus delivery — keeps the box's
        own chain and context, which is right: a service acting on its own
        initiative is not acting for anybody.

        ``for_session`` is the third case, and it is a *hook*: the kernel
        called this box at a doorway it opened **on some session's behalf**.
        Nobody is on the thread, so there is no caller to adopt, but the
        session is a fact the kernel holds and the box cannot learn — a
        ``turn_start`` hook that could not name the turn it was standing in
        wrote its prompt text to ``sessions.get(None)`` and silently reached
        nothing.

        **It moves the context and never the chain**, and that separation is
        the whole of why it is safe. The chain answers *who is asking*, and it
        is what decides attendance and therefore what may be approved; a
        service acting at a doorway is still acting on its own initiative, so
        it stays rooted at ``service:<name>``, stays unattended, and still
        cannot raise a dialog for anything unsafe. The context answers *whose
        world* — which session's rows, which user, which prompt — and at a
        doorway the honest answer is the session, not the kernel's default.

        ``target`` names which occupant, for a box holding several services;
        empty means the only one. Both are keyword-only, and that is not a
        style choice: the first positional here is already ``method``, and
        ``sandbox/hooks.py`` documents being bitten once by exactly that
        collision — a ``chain=`` parameter that a caller passed positionally
        and silently invoked as a method name.
