"""Runners — where sandboxed code actually executes.

Two modes, one calling convention, exactly as the security contract requires:
*the code functions the same either way, just with different levels of
security.*

- **in-process** (this module): the code runs on a worker thread with the SDK
  bound to a queue. Fast, no setup cost, and the validation script is the only
  thing standing between the code and the machine — so this mode is for code
  that is trusted, linted, and merely careless.
- **subprocess** (next): the same code, the same SDK, the same Requests, with
  the boundary enforced by the operating system rather than by a linter.

The in-process runner cannot kill a runaway thread — Python provides no such
primitive. It does not need to: every effect passes through the interpreter, so
cancelling an execution starves it of effects at its next Request. Code stuck
in a pure compute loop still burns a core, which is precisely the honest limit
of in-process execution and the reason subprocess mode exists.
