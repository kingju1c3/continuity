"""Resident boxes wearing a native face — services and frontends.

The other half of :mod:`sandbox.bridge`, split off because a residency is not
a call. A tool, task or command is adapted into a function that opens nothing
and returns; a service or a frontend is adapted into an object that *holds a
process* for its whole life, and everything that follows from that lives
here: the refcounted box two services can share, the hooks a service stands
at, the bus channels it listens to, the poll loop the kernel drives it with,
and the inverted start/poll/render loop a frontend runs inside.

Both halves build the same kind of thing — a native-looking subclass whose
methods forward into a box — so the construction machinery stays in
``bridge`` and is imported from here. The one call in the other direction is
``bridge.adapt`` reaching for the two entry points below, which it does with
a function-local import; a residency is reached *through* the bridge and
never instead of it.

Two shapes are worth knowing before reading:

- **A service box closes on a refcount, not on the first unload.** Services
  are the one family that may share a file, and when they do they share a
  box — ``service_embed.py`` holds a text and an image embedder so one torch
  import serves both. The kernel loads and unloads each by name with no idea
  they are neighbours, so the naive mapping kills a live model with no
  symptom beyond the survivor's calls failing.
- **A frontend inverts its loop.** A native frontend blocks in ``start()``
  forever, and a box takes one call at a time, so a guest that never returned
  would hold its box and no render could get in. The guest's ``start`` sets up
  and returns; the kernel calls ``poll`` repeatedly on the daemon thread
  ``FrontendManager`` already provides, and a render lands between polls.

    **The loop inverts.** A native frontend blocks in ``start()`` forever. A box
    serializes one call at a time, so a guest that never returned from ``start``
    would hold its box and no ``render`` could get in — the frontend would go
    deaf the moment it started listening. So the guest's ``start`` sets up and
    returns, and this adapter runs the loop on the daemon thread the frontend
    manager already gives it, calling ``poll`` over and over. Between polls is
    when a render lands.

    **Render methods become one call.** ``BaseFrontend`` hands subclasses typed
    methods; the box gets one ``render(kind, payload)``. Multiple wire methods
    for one concept is surface with no payoff, and this lets a guest
    handle the kinds its transport can show and ignore the rest.
