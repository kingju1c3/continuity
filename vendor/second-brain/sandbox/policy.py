"""The kernel policy function — the one place a security level is decided.

``classify`` is the whole authorization surface. Sandboxed code never
participates: a plugin declares *intent* by making a Request, and the kernel
alone decides what that Request is permitted to affect.

The level is computed from three inputs, per the security contract:

- **what** — the Request's type and arguments
- **who** — the chain of provenance, rooted in what caused the work
- **where** — the destination: a path, a host, a table, a user

Two levels. SAFE executes immediately; UNSAFE goes to the user for approval.
Nothing here is a property *of* a Request type — ``fs.write`` to scratch is
safe, the same Request aimed at ``main.pyw`` is not.

**One rule runs through the whole catalogue: widening capability is unsafe,
narrowing it is safe.** Adding a tool, injecting prompt text, enabling a job,
or loading a service changes what the agent may do next; the reverse never
does. Where a family had no obvious answer, that rule gave one.

#: *later* Request is answered. This is the test that will be got wrong, because
#: the settings it excludes read exactly like preferences from the outside:
#: ``net_allowed_hosts`` is "which sites", ``shell_allowed_prefixes`` is "which
#: commands", ``security_mode`` is "how careful" — and each of them is the
#: standing answer to a dialog, so writing one is granting yourself whatever it
#: covers. Anything named ``secret_*`` fails this too, and separately.
#:
#: **``active_agent_profile`` is the near miss, and the reason test 3 is
#: written down.** It is the obvious next entry — the same shape of choice as
#: the model, switched from the same panel, arguably more often — and it passes
#: tests 1 and 2 exactly as ``default_llm_profile`` does. It fails test 3, and
#: only test 3: an agent profile carries ``whitelist_or_blacklist_tools``, so
#: choosing one chooses **what the agent may call**. Writing it freely would let
#: an agent scoped to four tools move itself to a profile with all of them.
#:
#: **4. Somebody changes it constantly.** The first three ask whether an entry
#: is *harmless*; this one asks whether the exception is *worth making*, and it
#: is the test that keeps the list short. A dialog nobody sees twice costs
#: nothing and is one more thing that cannot go wrong, so a setting that passes
#: 1–3 and is touched once a year is pure downside — the risk of a rule read
#: slightly wrong later, bought for no relief at all.
#:
#: It has teeth. Applied to all 29 kernel settings, twenty-two fail test 3 and
#: two fail test 1 (``data_retention_days``, where a ``1`` destroys the action
#: ledger at the next sweep, and ``attachment_cache_size_gb``, where lowering it
#: evicts cached files) — but **four pass 1–3 and are excluded on this one**:
#: ``memory_index_cap``, ``max_workers``, ``poll_interval`` and
#: ``startup_restore_conversation``. Every one of them is a genuine preference
#: that grants nothing, and every one is set once and forgotten. They are named
#: here so the pass does not have to be done again, and so that reaching for one
#: of them later is a decision about *frequency* rather than a rediscovery of
#: whether it is safe.
#:
#: A note for whenever a *user-scoped* key is added: ``_config_write`` routes by
#: ``is_user_scoped``, not by the caller's ``scope`` argument, so the key name
#: is the unit here and at the storage layer alike — which is what makes a
#: key-only allowlist sound. The uid comes from the context, so there is no
#: reaching another user's blob; what changes is that "the setting" means one
#: per user, and the three tests have to hold for each of them.
#:
#: ``default_llm_profile`` passes all three, and earns the entry on volume:
#: switching model is something a person does many times a day, and a dialog
#: per switch is the kind of friction that teaches somebody to stop reading
#: dialogs. Note the value is deliberately **not** checked against the profiles
#: that exist. Every string is either a profile (a switch) or a name that
#: matches none (a broken pointer, loud at the next turn and fixed by the next
#: write), and neither is worth the layering it would cost policy to look.
#:
#: **Kept in code rather than in config**, which is the opposite call from
#: ``net_allowed_hosts`` one mechanism over, and deliberately: a *setting*
#: listing the settings that need no approval is a setting that grants
#: everything to whoever writes it, and it would have to exclude itself to be
#: safe at all. A list that can only be edited by editing this file cannot be
#: talked into growing.

# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The eight mechanisms.
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Of the ~110 Request types, the great majority are a flat lookup: a set
# membership in ALWAYS_SAFE or ALWAYS_UNSAFE. Only a handful are decided from
# their arguments, and every one of those uses one of **eight** mechanisms.
# They are the working vocabulary of this file, and writing them down is the
# difference between adding a ninth deliberately and growing an ad-hoc branch.
#
#   1. DESTINATION  — where is this aimed?
#      ``fs.write``, ``fs.write_bytes``, ``fs.move``, ``fs.delete`` against
#      ``_scratch_roots()``. The path decides; the content never does.
#
#   2. ALLOWLIST    — is this on a list a *person* maintains?
#      ``net.http`` against ``net_allowed_hosts``, matched on a dot boundary.
#      Deliberately config and not a plugin declaration — see the egress
#      section for why that distinction is the whole of it.
#      ``config.write`` against ``FREELY_WRITABLE_SETTINGS`` is the same
#      mechanism with the list in *code*, and the inversion is the point: a
#      setting naming the settings that need no approval would grant
#      everything to whoever wrote it. Which way round a list belongs is a
#      question about what the list authorizes, not a house style.
#
#   3. OWNERSHIP    — did the asker declare this thing?
#      ``secret.reveal`` and ``config.write``, resolved through the setting
#      registry (``_owns_setting``) so it is a fact the caller cannot assert
#      about itself.
#
#   4. SHAPE        — what does the payload actually say?
#      ``db.write`` via ``is_kernel_delete``. Sound here only because
#      ``conn.execute`` runs exactly one statement; see ``sandbox/users.py``
#      for why the same trick was wrong for the shell.
#
#   5. POLARITY     — does this widen or narrow?
#      ``task.pause``: pausing is safe, unpausing is not. The rule the module
#      docstring states, applied where a family had no other obvious answer.
#
#   6. ATTENDANCE   — is a person there?
#      ``ui.ask`` via ``attended_now``. About the chain's *root*, never about
#      which plugin family is asking.
#
#   7. PROVENANCE   — who caused this, exactly?
#      ``config.write`` via ``chain.typed_command``, and the ``chain.approved``
#      grant short-circuit at the top of ``classify``.
#
#   8. RECOGNIZER   — does a pluggable predicate vouch for it?
#      ``shell._SHELL_RECOGNIZERS`` holds two — a structural read-only check
#      and a *remembered* one reading ``shell_allowed_prefixes``.
#      ``_NET_RECOGNIZERS`` is empty, since egress is served by its allowlist
#      directly. This is the only one of the eight that is an extension point
#      rather than a rule, and it can only ever widen — see
#      ``sandbox/shell.py`` and ``docs/PERMISSIONS_MAP.md``.
#
# Three of these (1, 2, 8) can only ever widen, and abstain by failing closed.
# Three (3, 6, 7) read facts the kernel owns and guest code cannot state about
# itself. That split is not decoration: a mechanism a plugin could influence
# would be authorization by declaration, which is the bug ``isolation.py``
# exists to prevent, one level up.
