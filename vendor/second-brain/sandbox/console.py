"""The machine's console, owned by the kernel and lent to one frontend.

``input()`` is refused, and the three compounding reasons are in CLAUDE.md
under "The console is the kernel's, lent to one frontend". The mechanism:
**the host reads, the guest drains.** One thread here pulls lines off stdin
into a bounded buffer; ``console.read_line`` takes what has arrived and returns
immediately, so a frontend never blocks and renders keep landing between polls.
The child process never opens stdin at all, which is what lets a sandboxed REPL
run *more* isolated than the native one rather than less.

**One claimant**, declared by ``uses_console = True``; a second is refused,
because two readers would split a person's keystrokes non-deterministically
and present as dropped characters.

**Releasing does not stop the reader**, and that is the fix for the way the
above used to fail in practice. Releasing *did* stop it, which meant clearing
``_reader`` while that thread was still blocked in ``readline`` — so the
liveness guard could no longer see it, the next claim started a *second*
reader, and both then appended to one buffer. Worse, whichever orphan woke
first ran its ``finally`` and set ``_closed``, so the frontend that had just
successfully claimed the console got ``EOFError`` on its next read and stopped
itself. A frontend restart therefore killed the terminal.

There is one stdin per process and the reader is a daemon filling a bounded
buffer, so stopping it on release bought nothing. Release now drops ownership
and empties the buffer; the reader keeps running. The one case that genuinely
needs a new reader — a test injecting a different source — is handled by
generation, so a superseded reader can neither append nor declare the console
closed.

**The source is injectable.** ``start(source=...)`` takes any iterator of
lines, so tests drive a console without a terminal and a future frontend could
be fed from somewhere other than stdin. That is most of why this is a Request
rather than a builtin: ``input()`` can only ever mean the real keyboard.
