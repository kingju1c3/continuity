"""The bus, inbound — the only place that knows both sides of a delivery.

Emitting was always a Request; *hearing* needed building differently, because
an event arrives at a plugin rather than being asked for — there is no Request
to classify and no return value to translate. What there is instead is a
subscription, and a subscription can leak. So it is **declared, not
registered**, exactly as ``hooks`` are: the plugin never holds one, so it
cannot forget to drop one.

Two things this module owes the rest of the system:

**Payloads are projections.** ``bus.request`` enriches a payload with a live
``threading.Event`` and a result list (``events/event_bus.py``) so a subscriber
can answer synchronously. Neither can cross a process boundary, and a
sandboxed subscriber must not be able to satisfy a round trip it cannot be
trusted to complete — a box that hangs would hang the publisher. ``project``
drops them, along with anything else that will not serialize, and a sandboxed
subscriber therefore sees ``bus.request`` as an ordinary fire-and-forget event.

**Nothing here may raise.** ``EventBus.emit`` runs handlers on the publisher's
own thread and swallows what they raise; a listener that let an exception out
would be logged and ignored, but a listener that *blocked* would stall whoever
published. Delivery is best-effort at every layer, which is the same failure
policy the ledger has and for the same reason: an observer must never break
the thing it observes.

**And a guest never publishes on the thread that delivers** (``publish``). That
last sentence used to be advice; it is now structural, because the failure it
warns about was not hypothetical. A resident box serializes under one lock, and
``poll`` holds that lock for its whole duration — so a service emitting from
``poll`` parks its guest thread on the answer with the lock still held. The
kernel then runs ``bus.emit`` on a pool worker, on the *publisher's* thread by
``EventBus``'s own contract, and any subscriber that calls back into a service
blocks on the lock the publisher is holding. Neither side moves again.

That is precisely what the timekeeper did: fire ``subagent.spawn`` from
``poll``, and ``SubagentRegistry`` answered by asking the timekeeper to pin the
job's conversation. The deadlock wedged the box until the 600s hard ceiling
killed it permanently, and every later ``cron.*`` call parked another sandbox
worker on the same lock forever until the pool was gone and the whole process
went deaf.

A guest can never observe a subscriber — ``sdk.events.emit`` answers ``True``
and nothing else, and ``project`` already strips the round-trip keys so a
sandboxed subscriber cannot satisfy one. So answering immediately and
delivering on a kernel thread costs nothing anybody can see, and it is the
*one place* the fix belongs: a seventh subscriber cannot reintroduce this by
forgetting to detach, because detaching is no longer the subscriber's job.
This is the outbound twin of ``sandbox/handlers/kernel.py``'s ``_drive``.
