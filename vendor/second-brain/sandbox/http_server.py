"""A listening socket, owned by the kernel and lent to one frontend.

``socket`` and ``http`` are refused to a guest, and ``sdk.net.http`` — the
route the validator points at instead — is an outbound client. So a frontend
could talk to the world and never be talked to, which is fine for a transport
that polls somebody else's servers (Telegram) and impossible for one a client
connects *to*. This is that missing half, built the way
:mod:`sandbox.console` builds its own: **the host listens, the guest drains.**

The kernel accepts and parses into a bounded buffer; ``http.drain`` takes what
has arrived and returns immediately, so a frontend never blocks and renders
keep landing between polls. The child process never opens a socket at all,
which is what lets a sandboxed HTTP frontend run *more* isolated than a native
one rather than less — and it is why the ERROR-level refusal on ``socket`` can
stay exactly as it is. This adds a mediated route to a capability rather than
opening an unmediated one.

**Parsing is ``http.server``'s**, not ours. Only guests are refused it, and a
hand-rolled request parser is a hundred lines of exactly the code that is worth
not owning: header folding, malformed lengths, the difference between a slow
client and a finished one. What is written by hand here is the *response*
side, because that is where the inversion lives — a reply outlives the call
that produced it, which no handler-returns-a-body framework expresses.

**One claimant**, declared by ``serves_http = <port>``; a second is refused.
Two frontends on one port is not merely ambiguous, it is unbindable. The
declaration is the *default*: ``<name>_port`` in config wins when set, so a
person can move a port without editing a plugin.

**Releasing does not close the listener.** The console's docstring explains at
length how releasing its reader put two readers on one stdin; the failure here
is different in mechanism and identical in shape. Closing the socket on release
means the next claim has to rebind, and a listener that has just closed cannot
always be rebound immediately — so a frontend *restart* would intermittently
come back with no port, which is exactly the "restart killed the terminal"
outcome that reasoning was written about. Release drops ownership, answers what
was pending, and leaves the socket bound. While unowned the server answers 503
rather than buffering: nobody is going to drain it, and a client deserves to be
told that now rather than to time out.

**The source is injectable.** ``start(port, source=...)`` takes any iterator of
``(request, writer)`` pairs, so tests drive a server without a socket — the
same reason ``Console.start`` takes an iterator of lines, and most of why this
is a Request rather than something a guest could have done for itself.
