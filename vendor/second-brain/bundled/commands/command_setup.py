"""Slash command plugin for `/setup` — onboarding ramp.

Four phases, all in one pass:
  1. Packages — a fresh kernel ships no LLM backend or frontend, so setup leads
     by installing the `essentials` bundle, and points at /packages for
     more. Skipped automatically once an LLM backend is already installed.
  2. LLM — configure a default profile (Atlas Cloud fast-path or another provider,
     via the LiteLLM backend).
  3. Telegram — configure the bot, but only when the Telegram frontend is (being)
     installed.
  4. Web UI — install the HTTP frontend and mint its token, then print the
     build steps. The app is a separate repository that has to be cloned and
     built, so the wizard deliberately stops at what it can actually do:
     prompting for a `dist` path that does not exist yet would be a dead end.
