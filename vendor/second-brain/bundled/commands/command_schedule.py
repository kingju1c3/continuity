Kernel rather than store. It manages *any* Timekeeper job, the Timekeeper is a
kernel service, and subagent spawning is now a kernel capability — so a store
command was the only way to reach two things the kernel already owns.

Two kinds of thing can be scheduled, and the difference matters when reading
this file. A **background agent** is the kernel's own spawn channel: pick it
and you are asked for a prompt. An **event-driven task** is whatever the
pipeline has registered, scheduled by firing its trigger channel with a
payload shaped by its declared schema.
