"""Slash command plugin for `/mode` — how this conversation answers approvals.

Three modes, and they are the three answers a person can give to "may this
run?" before being asked it: ``lockdown`` (no), ``ask`` (ask me, the default),
``yolo`` (yes). The mode is what stands in for you at the approval dialog, and
nothing else — so what it can reach is exactly what would have interrupted you.

Kernel rather than a store package, for the reason ``/permissions`` is: a
safety surface that stops working when a package is uninstalled is worse than
none. It sits in the same category for the same reason — between them they are
the two commands that answer "what is allowed here", one standing on
destinations and one on time.

Ephemeral by design, and per conversation: the mode is not persisted anywhere,
so a restart returns to ``ask``, and it is scoped to the conversation it was
set in, so ``/new`` does too. A forgotten ``yolo`` that outlives the work it
was for is the one failure this must not have.
