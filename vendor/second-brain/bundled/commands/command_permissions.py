"""Slash command plugin for `/permissions` — see and withdraw standing grants.

The whole approval design rests on a grant being **enumerable and
withdrawable**: an answer nobody can find is an answer nobody can take back.
Three settings hold every standing grant the system has, and before this they
were three keys among thirty in ``/config``, discoverable only by knowing
their names.

One verb, deliberately. Adding by hand stays in ``/config``; this exists to
show what is granted and to revoke it, and keeping it to that is what makes
the listing scannable. The two footnotes are load-bearing for the same
reason the tables are — "what can it reach" is not answered by the lists
alone, because scratch and the workspace tree are always free and the app's
own files are never grantable.
