# A profile has two halves, and the difference runs through this whole file.
#
# **Its settings** are how to reach the model: endpoint, key, context size,
# which backend, what it can see. Every profile has all of them, whether or
# not anybody chose a value, so they can be edited and never removed.
#
# **Its provider parameters** are how the model should behave: temperature,
# reasoning effort, anything else the provider takes. They live together in
# ``llm_extra_params``, the kernel names no member of it, and each one is
# there only because somebody put it there — so each can be removed.
#
# The second half is not asked for when adding a profile. Everything in the
# first half is needed to reach the model at all; tuning is not, and a wizard
# that interrogates you about sampling before you have sent one message is
# worse than a menu entry you find when you want it.

    means already holding its URL and key.
