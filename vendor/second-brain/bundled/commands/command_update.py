#: The web app, relative to the repo root. One line rather than a search,
#: which is the whole dividend of the UI living in this repo: the store's
#: ``/update_ui`` had to read a launch agent's plist to find a *second*
#: checkout, verify the path it got back was absolute, and pull it separately.
#: A pull of this repo is now a pull of the UI.
UI_DIR = "frame_ui"

#: How a platform deploys the UI, if it does. The value is a command to run in
#: ``frame_ui/``, and it is used **only when the script it names is present** —
#: absence is the ordinary case (a dev server needs no deployment) rather than
#: a misconfiguration, so it is not an error.
#:
#: Keyed on ``sys.platform`` as ``paths.get("platform")`` answers it, so
#: ``darwin`` rather than ``macos``.
DEPLOY = {
    "darwin": ("deploy/macos/manage.sh", ["sh", "deploy/macos/manage.sh", "update"]),
}

#: Per step. Deliberately not the 600 ``proc.run`` allows, because that is not
#: the binding limit: a command box is killed at ``watchdog.HARD_CEILING`` (600
#: seconds of **wall** clock, which is not discounted for time blocked on the
#: kernel), so two steps sharing one command have to fit inside it together. A
#: cold ``npm install`` is seconds and a release build is a minute or two; five
#: apiece leaves the ceiling reachable only by something that has genuinely
#: hung, which is the case a deadline is for.

        Two steps, and the first is the one that is always needed: the pull
        moved the app's source but not its `node_modules`, so a changed
        `package.json` leaves a dev server importing something that is not
        there. `npm install` is a no-op when nothing moved, which is what makes
        it safe to run unconditionally.

        The second is deployment, and it exists only where there is something
        to deploy — a dev server reloads itself, while the macOS install serves
        a *build* that has to be made and activated. `DEPLOY` says how per
        platform and the script's presence says whether; a platform with
        neither is not broken, so this reports rather than raises.

        Failures are reported, never raised. The kernel is already updated at
        this point and saying so is the more useful half of the answer — an
        exception here would replace the commit summary with a stack trace
        about npm.
