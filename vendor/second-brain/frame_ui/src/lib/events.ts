 * Open the render stream. Returns a function that closes it.

 * last `id:` it saw as `Last-Event-ID`, and the server replays from there — so a
 * page refresh resumes instead of losing the turn it happened during. A
 * fetch-based reader would have to reimplement both halves of that.
 *
 * ## Why restarting the server needed a manual refresh, and what fixed it
 *
 * **`EventSource`'s own reconnection cannot be relied on to end.** The spec
 * gives it two behaviours: a stream that dies mid-flight is reopened on a
 * timer, and a *response* that is not `200 text/event-stream` fails the
 * connection permanently — `error` once, `readyState` `CLOSED`, nothing further
 * attempted. Neither guarantees the page ever hears about a backend coming
 * back, and a restart can land in a third state that is worse than both:
 * `CONNECTING`, indefinitely, with no event of any kind.
 *
 * That third state is what this deployment produces. Caddy stays up while its
 * backend is missing (see `docs/MACOS_DEPLOYMENT.md`) and its `reverse_proxy`
 * may hold a request rather than answer `502` — dialling, waiting, retrying
 * inside the one request the browser is waiting on. So the page saw the stream
 * drop, said "Reconnecting…", and then nothing happened ever again. A version
 * of this that retried only from `CLOSED` did not help, because `CLOSED` was
 * never reached.
 *
 * **So the rule below does not read `readyState` to decide whether to act.**
 * There is one state worth trusting, `OPEN`, and every attempt that has not
 * reached it is on a deadline from the moment it is made. A definite failure is
 * still worth noticing — it means the next attempt need not wait out the
 * deadline — but nothing depends on one arriving.
 *
 * The replay buffer holds the last 500 frames per session, so a long disconnect
 * drops the middle. A client that has been away a while should re-read state
 * rather than trust the replay; that is what `onRefetchThread` is for.
 *
 * One stream per thread: a second `GET /events` for the same thread replaces the
 * first, so mounting this twice silently steals the connection from the first
 * mount. React 19's development StrictMode double-invokes effects, which is
 * exactly that situation — hence the cleanup function, which must actually run.
 *
 * ## Coming back to a suspended page
 *
 * **`EventSource`'s own recovery only covers failures it noticed.** A phone that
 * suspends a backgrounded web app tears the connection down underneath it
 * without the page ever running the code that would see it, so the tab resumes
 * holding a socket that is `OPEN` and dead: no `error` event, the status line
 * still green, and nothing arriving until somebody reloads. On a tunnelled
 * connection to a machine that may itself have been asleep, that is the ordinary
 * way this app goes quiet rather than an exotic one.
 *
 * So returning to the foreground is treated as a reason to check rather than as
 * nothing, and `reopen` below is what a check that fails does about it.
