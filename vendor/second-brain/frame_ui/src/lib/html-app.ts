/**
 * The one bridge between agent-authored HTML and the kernel.
 *
 * **One `brain`, however many surfaces.** A widget mounted in the panel is a
 * document somebody else wrote, running in an opaque origin, needing a way to
 * ask the kernel for something. The file viewer used to run agent-authored
 * HTML the same way and is the reason this is a module rather than a function
 * inside `widget-frame.tsx`: two implementations meant two channel names and
 * two error shapes, so an agent writing HTML met a different `brain` depending
 * on where its file happened to land. That surface is gone — widgets replaced
 * it — and the relay stays parameterised, because the differences between
 * surfaces belong in arguments rather than in a second copy.
 *
 * What a widget passes is a stylesheet (so it inherits the app's look) and
 * being *told its box* — a widget is resized by a panel it cannot see.
