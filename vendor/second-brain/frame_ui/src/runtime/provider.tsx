/**
 * Where the stream, the store and assistant-ui meet.
 *
 * `ExternalStoreRuntime` is the right runtime for this server because it does
 * not own the conversation. It renders whatever array of messages it is handed
 * and calls back when the person does something — which is exactly our
 * relationship with the kernel: the server is the source of truth, the event
 * stream is the only thing that moves it, and this app is a projection. The
 * other runtimes all want to own a request/response cycle we do not have.
 *
 * Everything the chat window itself cannot express — the dialog for a question
 * the kernel is blocking on, the form panel, the connection status — is
 * published through `SecondBrainContext` rather than through the runtime,
 * because assistant-ui has no concept of them.
 *
 * Those questions get their own reducer rather than a slot on the conversation
 * store, and that is the point rather than tidiness: they belong to the
 * *session*, which outlives any one conversation, and living in the
 * conversation store meant a history read threw a live one away. See
 * `runtime/input-requests.ts`.
