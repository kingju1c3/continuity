 * SDK rather than assistant-ui's request config because this runtime is an
 * external store.
 *
 * assistant-ui's "primitives" are unstyled components that carry behaviour:
 * `ThreadPrimitive.Messages` knows how to iterate messages, `ComposerPrimitive.
 * Send` knows how to send. They read the runtime through context, which is why
 * nothing here is passed any props about the conversation.

 * never both — which made the composer useless for as long as the agent was
 * working: the only thing you could do with a thought was interrupt with it.
 * The kernel has always taken a message mid-turn and queued it for the next

 *
 * So: an empty box while the agent works can only mean stop, and a box with
 * something in it can only mean send it. Typing is what changes the button,
 * which is the rule people already know from Claude Code, and it costs nothing
 * to discover — nobody types into a composer they meant to press Stop on.
 *
 * `isEmpty` counts attachments too, so a staged file with no caption is a send
 * rather than a stop. See `runtime/provider.tsx`'s `queue` for why the Enter
 * key agrees with this button.
 *
 * **Only text is actually queueable**, and that is a kernel fact rather than a
 * choice made here: the busy guard in `runtime/conversation_runtime.py` queues
 * `send_text` and refuses `send_attachment` with "Still working." So a file
 * sent mid-turn comes back as that sentence in the transcript. It is offered
