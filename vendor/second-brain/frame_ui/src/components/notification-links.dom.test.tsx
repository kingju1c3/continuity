/**
 * Where a notification sends you, in a DOM.
 *
 * The reducer underneath is covered without one, and the rows themselves are
 * ordinary markup — but the two links out of the panel are not, for the same
 * reason `input-request-dialog.dom.test.tsx` needs a DOM: what is worth pinning
 * is a contract with Radix (a popover that closes, a section that survives being
 * asked for) rather than any function written here.
 *
 * The provider is stubbed rather than rendered. What is under test is which
 * callback fires with which argument, and standing up a real provider would put
 * an SSE connection between the test and the assertion.
