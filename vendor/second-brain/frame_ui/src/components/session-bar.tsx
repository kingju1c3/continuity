       * An icon button is a box with its glyph centred in it, so it brings
       * padding of its own to every edge; the status indicator is text and
       * brings none. One `gap` across the row therefore lands as two different
       * measurements — glyph to glyph read 16px and 24px on a desktop — and the
       * coarse-pointer floor pushed them further apart on a phone by growing
       * only the buttons. So the group sets no gap at all and pads the odd one
       * out to match, leaving a single rhythm that follows whatever size the
       * buttons happen to be.
       *
       * The gap on top of that is the desktop's original spacing between two
       * icon buttons, kept: padding alone makes the row even but also tighter
       * than it was, and there is room up here for the looser measurement. A
       * phone has no room to spare and the touch floor has already spent it,
       * so down there the padding is the whole of it.
