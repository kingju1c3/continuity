/**
 * @vitest-environment jsdom
 *
 * What is pinned here is the part that is invisible when it breaks.
 *
 * The panel's three modes are one element wearing three class lists, and the
 * reason for that — a React reparent remounts, and remounting a widget reloads
 * the document inside it — is a rule nothing enforces. So the first test walks
 * the modes and asserts the *same node* survives, which is the only way to
 * notice if somebody later moves the fullscreen branch into its own subtree.
 *
 * The rest is the tolerance arithmetic, which is pure and easy to get subtly
 * wrong: a clamp that lets the composer be squeezed fails on a window size
 * nobody tests at.
