/**
 * One widget, in one box.
 *
 * A widget is an HTML document written by somebody the frame has no reason to
 * trust — the store, or the agent. So the app does not run it; it *contains*
 * it, and then talks to it. Everything in this file is one of those two jobs,
 * and both of them go through `lib/html-app.ts`, the one relay, of which this
 * is the only caller.
 *
 * **The containment is `sandbox="allow-scripts"`, and the thing that matters is
 * what is missing.** Adding `allow-same-origin` beside it cancels the sandbox
 * out entirely: the widget gets this page's origin back, and with it the
 * same-origin proxy that puts a bearer token on every `/sdk` call. It would
 * then be able to make any Request Second Brain has, silently, without ever
 * holding the credential. Withheld, the document loads into an *opaque origin*
 * — its own, shared with nothing — and can reach this page only by posting a
 * message.
 *
 * **The document is delivered, not `srcdoc`-ed, and that is a deployment fact
 * rather than a preference.** A `srcdoc` frame inherits the embedding page's
 * Content-Security-Policy, and the production gateway serves this app with a
 * hash-only `script-src`. So every inline script in a widget — the bridge and
 * the author's own — is blocked the moment it is deployed, while working
 * perfectly in development, where Vite sends no policy at all. `/html-app-host
 * .html` is a real URL with its own policy (`sandbox allow-scripts;
 * script-src 'unsafe-inline'; connect-src 'none'`), which is both stricter
 * about the network and permissive about the scripts it is meant to run. The
 * host is handed the document by `postMessage` and writes it in.
