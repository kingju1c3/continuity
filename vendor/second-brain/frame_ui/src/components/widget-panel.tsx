/**
 * The widget panel: where a widget lives, in all three of the places it can be.
 *
 * On a desktop it is where the files drawer used to be — in the flow, so
 * opening it reflows the thread instead of covering the part you were reading.
 * On a phone it is a fixed split above the conversation. In both, the expand
 * control gives it the whole window. `runtime/widget-mode.ts` says why those
 * are one mode rather than three features.
 *
 * **It is one element in one place in the tree, and the mode is only CSS.**
 * That is the load-bearing decision in this file and it is not a
 * simplification: React reparents by remounting, so an `<aside>` that moved
 * between a flex row, a flex column and a fixed layer would tear down and
 * rebuild whatever is inside it on every mode change. A widget is an iframe —
 * a document with a scroll position, a half-typed field and possibly an open
 * stream — and remounting it reloads all of that, silently, presenting as
 * "going fullscreen resets my widget". So the three modes are three class
 * lists on one node, and `inert` rather than unmounting handles being closed.
 *
 * **The width is the person's and is remembered**, because a panel that resets
 * to a default on every reload is one you re-drag every morning. It is in
 * `localStorage` for the reason the sidebar's collapsed state is: it is a fact
 * about this window rather than about the account, and a `config.write` from
 * this page would raise an approval dialog for the crime of dragging a border.
