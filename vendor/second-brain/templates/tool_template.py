"""
TOOL TEMPLATE
=============
A tool is something the agent can call during a turn. Reference for authoring
one; not imported by the running system.

Read docs/SDK.md first — it covers the Request surface, the return idiom, and what
the validator rejects. Read sandbox/guest/bases.py for every attribute a tool
can declare. This file covers only what is specific to tools and cannot be
guessed from either.

Before writing: read docs/SDK.md, then this entire template. If a detail is not
specified here, inspect sandbox/guest/bases.py (the BaseTool contract),
sandbox/guest/sdk.py (call signatures), sandbox/validator.py (source rules),
and plugins/plugin_discovery.py (loading). Validate the finished file before
registering or relying on live reload.

  Where it goes:  DATA_DIR/workspace/tools/tool_<name>.py
  Filename:       must start with "tool_" — discovery is by filename
  Entry point:    run(self, sdk, **kwargs)

Live-loading is automatic when the plugin watcher is enabled: adding, editing,
or deleting the file loads, reloads, or unloads the tool.


THE DESCRIPTION IS THE PROMPT
-----------------------------
`description` is not documentation — it is the text the model reads when
deciding whether to call this tool, and it is the single biggest factor in
whether the tool gets used correctly. Write it as short operational docs:

  - what it does
  - when it is the right choice
  - the most important limit or failure mode

    "Read a UTF-8 text file by exact path. Use when the user has named a
     specific local file. Fails if the path is missing or is not readable text."

Vague hype and trigger words ("ALWAYS use this!") make a tool worse, not
better. Weak models read this literally, so ambiguity here costs real accuracy.


WHAT THE MODEL SEES VERSUS WHAT THE USER SEES
---------------------------------------------
This split is Second Brain specific and easy to get backwards:

  return value / data   -> the frontend, for display. NEVER sent to the model.
  llm_summary           -> what the model receives as the tool result.
  attachments           -> file paths the frontend renders (images, exports).

A bare `return x` sends a rendering of x to the model, which is what you want
most of the time. Reach for `sdk.ok(...)` when the model needs a different
view of the answer than the user does — a thousand rows to display, one
sentence to reason about:

    return sdk.ok(rows, llm_summary=f"{len(rows)} matching rows.")

Put the facts the model needs to act on next in `llm_summary`: what was found,
what changed, what failed, and any counts or paths it will need.


TOOLS VERSUS TASKS
------------------
Tools are called on demand and answer immediately. Tasks run in the background
over every file that appears. If it processes a corpus, it is a task.


BUDGETS
-------
  max_calls = 1          how many times the agent may call this per message

Leave it out. Unset means the user's `default_tool_max_calls` setting, which is
what governs almost every tool, and a tool is not the right place to decide how
much of a turn it deserves. Declare one only when the tool's own nature bounds
it — something that answers once and has nothing to add on a second call.

It is authority-bearing either way, so it is clamped: declaring a bigger number
is a request, not a grant.

Nothing here says whether a tool may run unattended, and nothing should: a
session with nobody in it refuses every unsafe Request anyway, so a tool that
asks the user something (sdk.ui.ask) fails there on its own. A declaration
would only be the contained code describing its own containment.


The three examples below are three separate tools, shown together for
contrast. A real file declares exactly ONE plugin class — the validator
enforces it, because discovery expects one class per file.

        either. This one is a real call into your box, so it is cached, and
        the cue above is what decides for how long. On "write" a read-only
        stretch is free and any effect anywhere invalidates it before the next
        model call, so the count below is genuinely live — a conversation
        started this turn is reflected on the agent's next call, which is the
        only reason to prefer this shape.

        The SDK belongs to the session whose prompt is being built, for cues of
        "session" or finer. Read ``(sdk.session.get() or {}).get("mode")`` when
        guidance depends on the effective security mode — and declare
        ``agent_prompt_refresh = "session"`` when that is *all* it depends on,
        which is both faster and moves the text into the cacheable part of the
        prompt.

        Keep it cheap: it runs on the turn thread. And never perform an effect
        here — on "write" you would invalidate your own cache and recompute
        forever, and on anything rarer you would do it without even that
        warning.
