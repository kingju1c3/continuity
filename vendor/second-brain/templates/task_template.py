TASK TEMPLATE
=============
A task is background pipeline work: it runs over files as they appear, or when
an event fires. Reference for authoring one; not imported by the running
system.

Read docs/SDK.md for the Request surface and sandbox/guest/bases.py for every
attribute a task can declare. This file covers what is specific to tasks.

Before writing: read docs/SDK.md, then this entire template. For details not
defined here, inspect sandbox/guest/bases.py (BaseTask declarations),
pipeline/orchestrator.py (dependency and run behavior), pipeline/event_trigger.py
(event tasks), and pipeline/database.py (run and output storage). Validate the
finished file before registering it.

  Where it goes:  DATA_DIR/workspace/tasks/task_<name>.py
  Filename:       must start with "task_"
  Entry point:    run(self, sdk, paths)

WATCH THE ARGUMENT ORDER: run(self, sdk, paths), sdk first. Getting this
backwards binds your paths to the sdk and fails in a confusing way.


TRIGGER KINDS
-------------
Every task picks exactly one:

  trigger = "path"    (default) keyed by file path. Root tasks (reads = [])
                      fire when a file is discovered; downstream tasks fire
                      when their upstream finishes.

  trigger = "event"   keyed by run_id. Fires when a declared bus channel
                      emits. Use for cron-like work, tool-triggered work, or
                      anything not per-file. Also set
                      trigger_channels = ["channel.name"].

The trigger decides your entry point, and getting it wrong fails silently:
"path" tasks implement run(self, sdk, paths) and "event" tasks implement
run_event(self, sdk, payload). A task with the wrong one registers, subscribes,
and is never called.

trigger_channels must be a literal list. trigger_channels = [SOME_CONSTANT]
reads as [] — it validates, registers, and subscribes to nothing.


THE DEPENDENCY GRAPH (the part you cannot guess)
------------------------------------------------
Tasks never reference each other by name. The orchestrator derives the graph
from `reads` and `writes` — but ONLY between tasks of the same trigger kind:

  TaskA (path) writes "text_chunks", TaskB (path) reads it
    -> TaskB is downstream of TaskA and fires when it completes.

  TaskA (event) writes "daily_summary", TaskB (event) reads it
    -> TaskB auto-fires after TaskA, with parent_run_id set.

Cross-kind reads are AMBIENT SQL JOINS, not graph edges. An event task that
reads a path-keyed table just SELECTs it at run time; changes to path data do
NOT invalidate event runs. If a path task needs to kick off an event run, it
emits on the channel explicitly with sdk.events.emit(...).

This is why adding a `reads` entry can silently change when your task runs.


ROWS ARE THE INTERFACE
----------------------
What you return is written to your output table and becomes the input of every
downstream task. Prefer explicit, stable column names — downstream tasks, SQL
inspection, and debugging all read them. Renaming a column is a breaking
change to a contract you cannot see from inside your own file.

Two fields exist for the pipeline rather than for you:

  also_contains     modalities discovered inside the file ("image" in a PDF),
                    which routes it to further parsers.
  discovered_paths  new files to register — how an archive extractor feeds
                    its contents back into the pipeline.


SHIPPING A SCHEDULE
-------------------
Create the timekeeper job from `on_install`, and remove it from
`on_uninstall`. Both run inside `/packages`, once, for the package the user
just asked for.

    job = {"channel": "schedule.tick.nightly", "cron": "0 3 * * *",
           "payload": {"scope": "all"}}

    def on_install(self, sdk):
        if sdk.services.call("timekeeper", "get_job", self.name) is None:
            sdk.services.call("timekeeper", "create_job", self.name, self.job)

    def on_uninstall(self, sdk):
        sdk.services.call("timekeeper", "remove_job", self.name)

Read-then-skip, so a job whose cron the user has edited is left alone. This
was a `default_jobs` declaration seeded at every registration, which meant a
job the user deleted came back at the next boot; the declaration is now
ignored and the validator says so. Declare `service.call`.


The two examples below are separate tasks, shown together for contrast. A real
file declares exactly ONE plugin class.
