COMMAND TEMPLATE
================
A command is a slash command a person types. Reference for authoring one; not
imported by the running system.

Read docs/SDK.md for the Request surface and sandbox/guest/bases.py for every
attribute a command can declare. This file covers what is specific to commands.

Before writing: read docs/SDK.md, then this entire template. For details not
defined here, inspect sandbox/guest/bases.py (BaseCommand declarations),
sandbox/guest/forms.py (sandbox form values), plugins/native/command.py (host
adapter and approval declarations), and state_machine/forms.py (form
progression). Validate the finished file before registering it.

  Where it goes:  DATA_DIR/workspace/commands/command_<name>.py
  Filename:       must start with "command_"
  Entry points:   run(self, sdk, args) and optionally form(self, sdk, args)

WATCH THE ARGUMENT ORDER: run(self, sdk, args), sdk first.

Commands are for interactive UI and workflow control. If the agent should be
able to call it, write a tool instead.


FORM STEPS ARE PLAIN DICTS
--------------------------
This is the one thing that will catch you. Natively, `form()` returned FormStep
objects. A FormStep is a live kernel object, so sandboxed code cannot hold one
— you return plain dicts and the kernel rebuilds them:

    return [{"name": "text", "prompt": "Enter the note text.", "required": True}]

Recognized keys: name, prompt, required, type, enum, enum_labels, default,
prompt_when_missing, columns. Unknown keys are dropped silently, so a typo
costs you that field rather than raising — check your spelling. `validator`
cannot be passed at all, because it is a callable; validate inside `run`.

Types are coerced before `run` sees them: "string" (default), "integer",
"number", "boolean".

Write each prompt as a user-facing instruction, not a field label:
"Enter the note text." beats "Text".


FORMS SUSPEND, AND THEY SURVIVE RESTARTS
----------------------------------------
Returning steps does not block. The command suspends onto the cache stack and
resumes when the user has answered — across an app restart, if it takes that
long. So `form()` may be called several times for one invocation, and it must
be cheap and free of side effects. Do the work in `run`.

For a dynamic form, look at what has been collected already and return only
the next steps needed. Returning [] means "ready, run now".


RETURN MARKDOWN — AND RETURN IT, DO NOT PUSH IT
----------------------------------------------
Command output is a string of GitHub-flavored markdown. Each frontend renders
it by its own policy — the REPL aligns tables and strips fences, rich
frontends render natively. Do not invent a structured return type; markdown is
deliberately the interchange format.

`return` is also the ONLY route. A command's answer travels on the
`callable_output` render kind, which is what lets a client keep its chat
transcript to the conversation and draw commands in a panel of their own.
Producing text any other way puts it in the chat instead.

This is invisible from a terminal — the REPL flattens both kinds and looks
identical either way — so it will not be caught by trying it. The three calls
that legitimately show text, and what each is for:

    sdk.ui.progress(line)                   "step 2 of 5", on the running
                                            command's own call. Silent when no
                                            command is running.
    sdk.session.push(text, notify=True)     the system TELLING them something,
                                            unprompted. Lands in the panel.
    sdk.ui.render(paths)                    you made a file they should see.

And `sdk.session.push` WITHOUT `notify=True` is for speaking into the
conversation, which a command never does. Its destination is the transcript.

Build the answer with the SDK helpers so it renders consistently everywhere:

    sdk.md.table(headers, rows)     data tables
    sdk.md.card(title, pairs)       describe-style key/value cards

Tables must start their own block — put a blank line before one, or markdown
parsers fold it into the preceding paragraph.

Return None for no visible message. Do not return an error string you would
rather raise: a raise becomes the `error` kind, stamped with which command it
came from. Return a string when the person should read and fix something
("Unknown setting: colour"); let a real failure raise.


The two examples below are separate commands, shown together for contrast. A
real file declares exactly ONE plugin class.
