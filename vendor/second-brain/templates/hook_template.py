HOOK TEMPLATE
=============
A hook stands at a doorway in the agent turn and gets a say in what happens.
Reference for authoring one; not imported by the running system.

Read docs/SDK.md for the Request surface and sandbox/guest/hooks.py for the payload
and verdict definitions. This file covers what is specific to hooks.

Before writing: read docs/SDK.md, then this entire template and
templates/service_template.py, because hooks live on services. For details not
defined here, inspect sandbox/guest/hooks.py (moments, payloads, and verdicts),
runtime/hooks.py (kernel traversal), and sandbox/bridge.py (service adapter).
Validate the service file before registering it.

  Where they live:  inside a SERVICE — see templates/service_template.py
  Declared by:      hooks = {moment: method_name}
  Signature:        method(self, sdk, ctx, payload)

Every agent turn is the same short ritual: the turn starts, the model thinks,
the agent acts, think/act repeats, the turn ends. The hook system puts a
labeled doorway at every moment of that ritual, and the one rule is: NOTHING
influences a turn except by standing at a doorway. If nobody is registered,
the kernel walks straight through and behaves exactly as it would with no
hooks at all.


A HOOK IS INBOUND — WHICH IS WHY IT IS DECLARED
------------------------------------------------
Everywhere else in the SDK your code asks and the kernel answers. A hook is
the reverse: the kernel calls you. There is nothing to call at load time, so
there is nothing to register — you declare it, and the kernel reads the
declaration without importing your file:

    class Doorman(BaseService):
        name = "doorman"
        hooks = {"end_turn": "check_done"}

Uninstalling the service removes its hooks with it. A hook cannot leak,
because you never registered it in the first place.

Hooks live in services because something has to be RESIDENT for the kernel to
call into. A tool is gone the moment it answers; a service is still there.


THE SIX MOMENTS (in the order a turn meets them)
------------------------------------------------
  moment            kind       what standing there means
  ----------------  ---------  ------------------------------------------------
  "turn_start"      adjuster   The agent is about to begin. Slip a note into
                               its pocket via sdk.session.add_prompt(...).
  "shape_scope"     adjuster   Here are the tool NAMES the agent will see;
                               return the ones to keep.
  "vet_permission"  verdict    Something sensitive wants to happen; say yes,
                               say no, or stay silent.
  "llm_call"      escort     Own the round trip to the model: rewrite the
                               request, place the call, inspect the answer,
                               go around again if you don't like it.
  "end_turn"        verdict    The doorman at the exit: let the agent leave,
                               send it back with a note, or demand one last
                               tool call first.
  "turn_finish"     observer   The turn is over; look at what happened.


ABSTAIN BY RETURNING None
-------------------------
It is the default and it is what composes. A hook that speaks only when it
must works alongside every other plugin.

A hook that RAISES is logged and skipped — it can never break a turn. So is
one whose service is unloaded, or whose box has died. The worst a hook can do
is fall silent.


HOW TWO HOOKS SETTLE A DISAGREEMENT
-----------------------------------
"end_turn"       first non-None wins. An early Allow waves the agent through
                 and later doormen are not consulted.
"vet_permission" DENY BEATS ALLOW. Every gate is asked and any refusal wins,
                 however late it comes.
"shape_scope"    folds — every shaper runs, each narrowing what the last one
                 left.

The two verdict doorways differ because the cost of being wrong differs: a
doorman that guesses wrong costs a turn, a gate that guesses wrong costs a
capability. Gates used to be first-wins too, which meant that with one
permissive gate and one restrictive gate, plugin load order — in practice
filename order — silently decided policy.


KEEP THEM FAST
--------------
Hooks run synchronously on the drive thread, inside every turn they touch.
Each one adds a box round trip (~70µs in-process, ~120µs subprocessed) to the
latency of every reply, and it is paid whether or not you end up having an
opinion.

That is PER CONSULTATION, not per turn, and two doorways are consulted more
than once. A scope shaper is asked 3 + one-per-model-call times, because the
tool list is rebuilt for the specs, for the loop, and for every prompt — so a
six-tool-call turn asks it ten times. A gate is asked once per unsafe Request.
Do the expensive thing in a task and read its result here.


WHAT CROSSES, AND WHAT DOES NOT
-------------------------------
A payload is a PROJECTION, not the kernel object encoded. You get what a hook
can act on:

  ctx           session_key, user_id, conversation_id, attended
  TurnEnding    final_text, reason, doorman_fires
  TurnOutcome   ok, cancelled, final_text
  PermissionQuery
                tool_name, command, stage, origin, request, chain
  Scope         tools — a list of NAMES
  ModelRequest  llm (a name), messages, tools, tool_choice, params

Two consequences worth knowing:

  - A scope shaper can only HIDE. Names you invent are ignored, and the order
    you return them in is discarded — the names arrive sorted and what you
    hand back is kept as a set. To add a tool, use sdk.session.add_tool(...).
  - request.llm is the backend's NAME, not the backend. Assign another loaded
    backend's name to swap brains for that one call.


THE FIRE BUDGET
---------------
Doormen may intervene at most DOORMAN_FIRE_LIMIT times per turn. Past that
they are no longer consulted and the agent always gets to leave — a stubborn
doorman can never trap a turn. Write doormen to abstain once satisfied (check
ending.doorman_fires or your own state), not to rely on the cap.
