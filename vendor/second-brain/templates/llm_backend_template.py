"""LLM BACKEND TEMPLATE — how Second Brain talks to a model.

Read docs/SDK.md first, then this entire template. Copy the result to
``DATA_DIR/workspace/llm/llm_<provider>.py``. The folder and name matter:
``llm/llm_*.py`` is how the registry finds a backend. There is no top-level
``helpers/`` directory.

For details not defined here, inspect sandbox/guest/llm.py (the request,
response, and streaming contract), llm/registry.py (discovery, profiles, and
pooling), sandbox/guest/sdk.py (LLM Requests), and sandbox/isolation.py
(containment). Validate the finished file before loading its profile.

A backend is **not a plugin**. There is no family, no entry point, and nothing
discovery registers — same as a parser. It is a class the kernel loads into a
box and calls. Its dedicated ``llm/`` root exists because the model registry,
not plugin discovery, finds and pools it.

WHAT YOU ARE HANDED, AND WHAT YOU GIVE BACK
    def chat(self, sdk, request: LLMRequest) -> LLMResponse

That is the whole contract. ``request`` carries the model name, the messages,
the tool schemas, the connection settings, and any attachments the kernel has
already decided this model can read natively. You return one ``LLMResponse``,
whether you streamed or not.

WHY THE PROFILE IS ON THE REQUEST AND NOT ON YOU
Every connection detail arrives per call, so two boxes running this file are
interchangeable. That is what lets the kernel keep a *pool* of them and serve
concurrent calls in parallel — a scheduled subagent does not queue behind a
foreground turn. Storing ``self.model_name`` in ``start`` would quietly break
that, and the symptom would be a subagent talking to the wrong model.

Keep in ``start`` only what is genuinely per-process: the imported library, a
connection pool, a tokenizer.

# Backends are the strongest case for isolation in the whole system: foreign
# code, a network socket, and an API key, all at once — and they get it without
# asking. Isolation is not declared: the kernel decides it from where the file
# lives, and an installed package importing a provider SDK is subprocessed
# because the validator can see that import. Code does not get a say in how
# contained it is.

# Loading a provider library is expensive and must happen once, not per call.

# ── THE API KEY, HONESTLY ───────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# ``request.api_key`` is plaintext, and that is a real exception to how the
# rest of the sandbox handles credentials.
#
# Everywhere else a secret is a ``<secret:name>`` handle the kernel
# substitutes inside ``net.http``, so plugin code uses a credential it never
# holds. That only works because the kernel makes the outbound call. A
# provider SDK opens its own socket, so there is no Request for the kernel to
# substitute into, and the key has to be inside the box to be usable at all.
#
# The subprocess boundary is what remains: the key is in a separate process
# that can only reach the world through Requests the kernel classifies. Making
# it stronger would need real OS containment, which is a container, not a
# linter. If you can reach the provider over plain HTTP, prefer
# ``sdk.net.http`` and the handle — you get the substitution back.
