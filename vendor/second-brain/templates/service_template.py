"""
SERVICE TEMPLATE
================
A service is a long-lived capability other plugins call: a loaded model, a
connection pool, a cache. Reference for authoring one; not imported by the
running system.

Read docs/SDK.md for the Request surface and sandbox/guest/bases.py for every
attribute a service can declare. This file covers what is specific to services.

Before writing: read docs/SDK.md, then this entire template. For details not
defined here, inspect sandbox/guest/bases.py (BaseService declarations),
sandbox/bridge.py (kernel adapter and exports), sandbox/guest/hooks.py (turn
hooks), and sandbox/guest/sdk.py (service calls and Requests). Validate the
finished file before registering it.

  Where it goes:  DATA_DIR/workspace/services/service_<name>.py
  Filename:       must start with "service_"
  Entry points:   start(self, sdk) and stop(self, sdk), plus its exports

A SERVICE IS A PERSISTENT BOX
-----------------------------
Services are the natural persistent box, and the only family that is one by
default. The box is loaded once, keeps its state, and is serialized — one call
at a time. You do not manage this; it follows from the family.

The rule that shapes everything else: STATE STAYS INSIDE THE BOX. The model,
the connection, the cache — those never cross the boundary. Callers get simple
data back and the thing itself never leaves. If you find yourself wanting to
return a client object so the caller can use it, export a method that does the
work instead.

Note the two similar words. Native services declare
`lifecycle = "managed" | "extension"`, about *who loads them*. Sandboxed
plugins declare `lifetime = "ephemeral" | "persistent"`, about *whether the
box survives between calls*. Services set the second one for you.


EXPORTS ARE THE PUBLIC SURFACE
------------------------------
Only methods named in `exports` are reachable through sdk.services.call.
Everything else is internal. This is what makes "which service methods can a
plugin call?" answerable by reading the file instead of guessing.

    exports = ["embed", "similarity"]

Every exported method must return simple data — the same constraint as any
Request return value. Exports are read without importing the file, so the list
must be a literal.


FOREIGN LIBRARIES AND CREDENTIALS
---------------------------------
Services are where foreign libraries usually live, and the honest position is:
a library that does its own I/O cannot be mediated. Two consequences:

  1. You get a subprocess automatically, and cannot decline one. Isolation is
     decided by the kernel from where the file lives — an installed package
     that imports a foreign library is subprocessed because the validator can
     see the import. There is nothing to declare.
  2. If it needs a credential, you genuinely need the plaintext, because there
     is no Request for the kernel to substitute a handle into.

Name any credential setting `secret_something` — that prefix IS the
declaration. It then reads back as a `<secret:name>` handle, which the kernel
substitutes inside sdk.net.http, so code uses a credential it never held.

When a foreign library needs the real value:

    key = sdk.secrets.reveal("secret_my_api_key")

A plugin reading a key it declared in its own `config_settings` is not asked —
configuring it was the consent, and prompting on every load would be exactly
the approval fatigue this design avoids. A DIFFERENT plugin reaching for that
same key does get a dialog. Once you hold plaintext you are responsible for it.


STANDING AT A DOORWAY
---------------------
Services are also where hooks live, because something has to be resident for
the kernel to call into. Declare them and write the methods:

    hooks = {"end_turn": "check_done"}

See templates/hook_template.py for all six moments and their payloads.


LISTENING TO THE BUS
--------------------
Same shape, same reason: declare the channels and write one handler.

    subscribed_channels = ["task_completed"]

    def on_event(self, sdk, channel, payload):
        ...

A channel you did not declare is never delivered. Only services and frontends
can subscribe at all — a tool is a call that ends, so there would be nothing
left to deliver to.

Two things bite here. Handlers run **on the thread that emitted**, so a slow
on_event slows down whoever published — enqueue a task instead of doing real
work. And a channel name is just a string: the kernel's live in
events/event_channels.py, but plugins own their own, so nothing checks the
spelling and a typo is silence rather than an error.


DRIVING WORK ON A SCHEDULE
--------------------------
A service never imports the orchestrator or the tasks it drives. It emits, and
whatever declared that channel fires:

    sdk.events.emit("schedule.tick.daily", {"source": "my_service"})

Prefer a task with a timekeeper job over a thread in a service — the
timekeeper already owns the clock, and a guest may not start a thread.
