"""
Kernel event channel registry.

Declaring channels in one place is the discipline that keeps the event bus
from becoming a dumping ground. If adding a channel feels like it needs
justification, that's the point — use the bus only when the producer and
consumer are architecturally far apart. For anything tightly coupled or on
the hot path, call the function directly.

**Scope: this file documents channels the *kernel* produces or consumes.**
The bus itself needs no registration (a channel is just a string), so a plugin
owns its own channels — it defines the constant + payload doc at the top of its
module (relative-imported by siblings in the same family) and emits/subscribes
there. A plugin channel must NOT be declared here, even speculatively: the
kernel must not carry contracts for code it doesn't contain (uninstall the
plugin and its channel should vanish with it). Kernel-produced channels may, of
course, be *subscribed to* by plugins — that's the whole point of emitting them
unconditionally.

Payload shapes are documented here, not enforced at runtime.

frontends needed and could not make; the announcement half moved to
NOTIFICATION_PUSHED. What is left is conversation: the model's mid-turn
narration alongside a tool call, and the files a tool shows through
``sdk.ui.render``. Both are the agent's turn speaking, and both belong in the

The distinction CHAT_MESSAGE_PUSHED could not draw. That channel carries two
populations: text belonging to the agent's own turn — the model's mid-turn
narration, a tool showing a file through ``sdk.ui.render`` — and announcements
from elsewhere in the system that merely have nowhere else to appear. A
frontend receiving only ``render_messages`` cannot tell them apart, so a plugin
registering itself and the agent answering a question arrive as the same kind
of thing.

The line is *who was speaking*: a push made while the agent's turn owns the
session is conversation and stays on CHAT_MESSAGE_PUSHED; everything else is a
notification. That is decided at each emit site rather than inferred from the
channel, so a future producer cannot land on the wrong side by accident.

``source`` is stamped by the kernel, never by the producer that asked. For
sandboxed code it is read off the live provenance chain (see
``runtime.notifications.notify``), which is precisely the part of a chain a box
cannot state about itself — the same property ``sandbox.approval.describe_asker``
and the ledger's ``actor_id`` rely on.

its own conversation and closes its session when it finishes

CONFIG_CHANGED = "config_changed"
"""Persisted configuration was written. Lets multi-client frontends resync a
settings panel without polling. Emitted unconditionally so a plugin can
subscribe without kernel edits.
Payload:
    scope: str — 'core' | 'plugin'  (user-scoped settings live in the users
                 table, written elsewhere, and are not covered here)
    keys:  list[str] — the setting *names* that changed, sorted. Names only,
                 never values: config holds tokens, and this is the same rule
                 the ledger's config_save row follows. Empty when a save
                 rewrote the file without changing anything."""

# TABLE_WRITTEN        — after DB.write_outputs; finer-grained than TASK_COMPLETED
#                        (which already carries rows_written), for reactive
#                        aggregate tasks that key off a specific table
# TOOL_CALL_PROGRESSED — symmetry with COMMAND_CALL_PROGRESSED, once tools can
#                        report incremental progress for a long-running call
