# The mirrored code trees are declared in ``trees.py``, which imports this
# module. Anything wanting a tree path (``trees.WORKSPACE``, ``trees.INSTALLED``)
# or a directory inside one asks there — the layout is one table, and a path
# spelled in two files eventually gets spelled two ways.
#
# The attachment cache used to be ``DATA_DIR/attachment_cache`` and is declared
# here no longer: it lives in the agent's own tree now, so it is
# ``trees.attachment_cache()``. ``migrations.py`` moves an older one across.
