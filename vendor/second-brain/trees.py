"""Which trees exist, and what kinds of file a tree may contain.

Two facts decide where any piece of extension code lives, and until this module
existed neither was written down in one place.

**Who finds it.** A root whose files carry a *prefix* is scanned: something
globs ``f"{prefix}*.py"`` and builds an index. A root with no prefix is only
ever reached by something naming the file — imported, or run. That is the whole
distinction between ``tools/`` and ``scripts/``, and it is why a script needs no
``script_`` prefix: the directory is already the declaration, and taxing the
cheapest capability only pushes work back through ``proc.run``.

**Who put it here.** Three local trees — the app's own (``bundled``), the
store's (``installed``), the agent's (``workspace``) — plus the store branch
itself, which is the same shape reached over git rather than a filesystem.
Precedence runs bundled → installed → workspace, matching discovery order.

A root is declared here **only when the kernel itself routes it**. That test
admits ``parsers/`` and ``llm/`` (kernel registries live in ``parsing/`` and
``llm/``) and ``scripts/`` (``script.run``, ``isolation.is_script``,
``policy._classify_script``) beside the five plugin families. It admits
``widgets/`` too, and that one is worth saying out loud because it is the
first root that is **not Python**: a widget is a piece of the web UI, and the
browser it runs in can reach no disk at all — so the only way `frame_ui` can
learn which widgets exist is to ask the kernel, over the same SDK it asks
everything else. That is the routing, and it is why the answer is a root here
rather than a folder `frame_ui` globs for itself. What a widget *is* — how it
is validated, and what contains it once it runs — is a separate question with
a separate answer, and none of it belongs to this table. It excludes
``bundles/``, which exists because of store packages and which the package
layer keeps handling on its own. It also excludes ``workspace/memory/``, which
the kernel *does* name — ``agent.system_prompt`` inlines its ``MEMORY.md`` —
but only ever in the one tree the agent writes: a root is a shape every tree
holds, and a bundled or installed ``memory/`` would mean nothing. The store's
memory tool owns everything inside it. Adding a root here is a claim that core code needs standing
knowledge of it — the same question CLAUDE.md asks before widening the kernel
boundary.

**There is no top-level ``helpers/``.** A helper exists to help a plugin, so it
lives inside the family it helps (``<tree>/tools/helpers/x.py``). The root used
to exist because parsers and LLM backends had nowhere else to go, which made
"not a plugin" the definition of a folder that two kernel registries were
scanning.

This module lives at the repo root rather than under ``plugins/`` because
``sandbox/isolation.py`` and ``sandbox/policy.py`` both need it and both refuse
to import ``plugins.*`` — the sandbox may not depend on the plugin substrate to
answer a question about containment. ``paths.py`` is already the shared home for
exactly this kind of knowledge; this is its companion.
