"""One-shot DATA_DIR layout migrations, run at boot before anything reads it.

Stdlib only and import-light: this runs ahead of the app proper, before the
config package or anything else that reads the trees. Every step is idempotent
and guarded by "does the old thing still exist", so a second boot is a no-op
and an interrupted run resumes.

The rule throughout is **never guess**. A file that does not match what a step
expects is left where it is and reported, because the cost of leaving a stray
file behind is a log line and the cost of moving the wrong one is an agent's
work disappearing into a folder nobody looks in.
